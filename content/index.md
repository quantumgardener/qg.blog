Welcome to The Quantum Garden, a site where I share what interests me in the hope you'll find it interesting as well.

Time spent in the garden is all about cultivating possibilities in life. Often the possibility is already there and waiting to be seen.

Here I am opening sharing my learning. There is a mixture of well thought out concepts, half-baked concepts and even nebulous thoughts. Like any natural garden, [[A digital garden's content is always growing]]. You can learn more by reading [[Designing The Quantum Garden]].
## Getting around the garden
Any good garden needs a map and within this garden, content is heavily connected using [[Map of content|Maps of content]]. The best overview comes from the [[Universal Map of Concepts]] which provides the jumping in point for most of the notes and other more details maps (think of them as inserts on the main map).

[[Backlinks are important]] and every page will list the others that link to it. Something similar is presented in the [[Graph view]].

There is a traditional search accessible via the **Search bar** or via `CTRL-K` on the keyboard.
