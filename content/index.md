Welcome to The Quantum Garden, a site where I share what interests me in the hope you'll find it interesting as well.

Time spent in the garden is all about cultivating possibilities in life. Often the possibility is already there and waiting to be seen.

Standing on the edge of the garden you can see several intriguing [[Landscapes|landscapes]] spread out in front of you. Where do you want to head first? Visit a landscape or learn a little more [[About|about me]]. Your choices of landscape are:

- [[expand-your-way-of-being|Expand Your Way of Being]] 
- [[hobby-together|Hobby Together]] 
- [[productive-laziness|Productive Laziness]] 
- [[digital-gardening|Digital Gardening]] 
- [[the-garden-shed|The Garden Shed]]
