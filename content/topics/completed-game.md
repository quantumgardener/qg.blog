A list of computer games I've completed, added to as I complete them (which is pretty rare I must say compared to some people but which did have a decided uplift during COVID-19 lockdown in 2020). "Completion" means playing through the main story line but for some games, they are not possible to complete so if I've played what I think is a sufficient amount, they are listed here.

Games are tagged for the platform they were played on, not the one they are necessarily launched on. Some have been played on multiple platforms and are listed for each. This is consistent with the principle that I [[Don't duplicate public knowledge]].
