# Initial Impressions (11 December 2023)
I started playing a couple of days ago. It has taken some time to get into the flow of the game. That's typical with any new game of this type. Many mechanics to learn - I am familiar with D&D - and controller buttons to sort out.

Eventually I slowed myself up enough to look around during combat and take the time. Still faster than a normal D&D game would be yet much slower than a "computer game". One of the biggest issues was accidentally hitting `Triangle` to select a combat action instead of `R1`. That's a problem because `Triangle` ends the characters combat round. Whoops! Speaking with a mate today he told me I can adjust the controls so that requires a hold press rather than a tap press.

The story is developing well and I look forward to many hours of gameplay to come.
