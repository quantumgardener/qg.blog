Yesterday I was given a gift that the giver may not even be aware of. I was relating to JJ how I'd made a shift in how I saw myself and that I now consider myself a coach. She recalled how just a few weeks ago I was "investigating coaching".

Thank you JJ for listening to what I said those weeks ago. Thank you for bringing it to mind and reminding me of the shift I've made. Thank you for supporting what I'm doing.
