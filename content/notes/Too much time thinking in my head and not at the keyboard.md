I do this. It stops me from writing and building a bank of useful notes. It also prevents connection between ideas. 

Already this morning I've have several ideas begging to be put to paper (including this) and I recognise the push in my mind to write and the counter-push not to. I don't write because:
- I say to myself I can remember that; and for sort notes such as a book I might want to read, I can.
- I am away from [[Obsidian]]—my preferred writing tool—and that is enough barrier to hold me back. Of course, that's why I end up writing in my head. I could take [[Fleeting note|Fleeting notes]] that [[Mastering the chaos of source notes|I'm not sure I'll get to]] and the compounds.

I want to get past the inertia that is holding me back and creating stress at not moving forward. I **know** writing helps me. The words above prove it. Recognising the barrier I'm failing to break through and why allows me to chose a different option next time.
