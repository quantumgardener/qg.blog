The outside ring of the [[Graph view]] is showing a considerable number of solitary (or paired) notes unconnected to the corpus. Interspersed across the whole model are many red notes that are alluded to, but which don't yet exist.


| Dot colour | Means...                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Green      | Note exists                     |
| Red        | Note missing                    |
| Blue       | Note exists, [[Map of content]] |


The goal is to start on the outside and progressively weave the knowledge together.
