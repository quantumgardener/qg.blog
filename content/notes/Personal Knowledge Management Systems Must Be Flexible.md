Any [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system must be flexible. It needs to accommodate:

- changes in taxonomy - knowledge is not fixed, and certainly our interpretation of knowledge is open to change. That comes from [[Being a Learner]].
- changes in document format - knowledge comes in many forms and it's frequently a low-value activity to convert from one format to another, unless converting into a searchable format from one that is not searchable.
- local and remote access (and security) - what is the point of creating a system that acts as a second brain if you can't have it accessible wherever you need it. Remote access does require the need for security.
- new learning about PKM practices - there are new ideas in the PKM space all the time and they can help with looking at knowledge in different ways. Don't get caught in the trap of rearranging all the existing documents to meet a new system.
- new learning full-stop - the system is at its best when it illuminates new knowledge
