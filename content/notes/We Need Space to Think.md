This seems intuitive but what do we mean by it?
## What is Space?

Space is the distance between one thing and another.
Space is the distance between one time and another.

The space can reduce the effect of noise. It raises the [[Signal to Noise Ratio]]. The more space the more distant the signal that can be heard. This is just like the space between Earth and the furthest reaches of the galaxy. 

> [!note] My Calling
> Something dear to me is [[Bringing Humanity to the Workplace]]. It was the quietest thought in my mind and took a long time to arise. But once recognised I knew it had been there all along.

Cutting my work time to 4-days/week is a deliberate way to create space and let ideas flow. The morning of my second Friday I was almost overwhelmed with connections and ideas pouring into my stream of consciousness (arising? growing? surfacing? as they were already there perhaps). A direct affect of not being in the office and having time to let my mind think and react on my own timeline.

## Why Do We Need To Think?

If we don't think and make creative connections, we undervalue our importance to others. Each of us has a unique perspective on the world and therefore a unique way we can [[Offer]] assistance to others close by and far away (in physical and time space - back to space again)

Our process of thinking, and the connections we make come from our individual [[Way of Being]].

Thinking is a valuable activity. We underrate that. I once heard the advice to never interrupt someone staring out a window. I think of that every time I stare out a window.

## The Emergence of Thinking Spaces as an Idea

> [!Note] Thinking Spaces
> The emergence of [[Thinking Space]] as an idea has come directly out of me creating one for the initial draft of this note.

Thinking can't be left to chance. We must be deliberate about creating space and having some goal with our thinking. Is there a problem to solve, is there something we want insight into. Even deliberately entering a [[Thinking Space]] with the goal of letting thoughts arise and listening to them is a valid (see [[Meditation activities I get lost in]] and [[Proprioceptive writing]] as examples of this).

It feels bloody good to be in a [[Thinking Space]]. It makes me feel grounded and more sure of myself (except for those times where the thoughts are too many and overwhelming - probably a sign that I'm not in a [[Thinking Space]] and have simply let thoughts run rampant).

I will deliberately create a [[Thinking Space]] by standing and changing my location for a few minutes. Usually I come back to a whiteboard to help refine the rush of ideas that moving has allowed. I have created the distance between one space and another.
