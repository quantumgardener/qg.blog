I finished [[A Plague Tale - Requiem|A Plague Tale: Requiem]] on [[2024-11-01|1 November 2024]]. It is a worth successor to [[A Plague Tale - Innocence|A Plague Tale: Innocence]] that builds on the original story to a satisfying conclusion.

The adventure centres on Amicia de Rune and her brother Hugo as they continue their struggle to rid Hugh of the Prima Macula, that uncontrolled brings death in the form of rats and the plague.

Chapters 1 through 5 had me worried. The gameplay and story was heading down a fetch quest path with no signs of expanding beyond the original. However, afterwards the story really kicked in with some new characters and interactions.
