Just so you know:

- It's OK to delete all those saved articles you haven't read yet

- It's OK to scroll to the top of your Mastodon/Facebook/X feed and skip what everyone has done his week/day/hour

- It's OK to put a book aside that you aren't really enjoying. Same with that movie or TV series you committed to because your "everyone" said you should watch it.

- It's OK to not feel OK sometimes.

Take a load off. Show yourself some compassion. You don't have to do everything.
