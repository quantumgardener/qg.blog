[[IMatch]] is the [[Digital asset management]] software used to manage our family library of photos and videos called [[Mediabank]]. It has supported the family's [[Photography]] in all forms since [[2002-10-31|October 2002]].

I've owned every version since IMatch 3 over many years. It is a legitimately powerful application. During that time the built-in features of the application have become more advanced and what I once needed scripting for, is now built-in.

The features of [[IMatch]] which make it so powerful for me are:

- outright speed
- capability to write metadata to photos and videos, or the ability to export anything, ultimately reducing lock-in
- categories for managing metadata that doesn't have a place in an image such as private information and workflow progression
- GPS mapping
- face detection
- keyword detection
- scripting
