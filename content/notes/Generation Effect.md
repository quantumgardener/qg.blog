This reminds me of the common theme I've heard from [[personal knowledge management]] over the last 2 years. That is, make notes in your own words. Research has shown you remember better your own notes. I've experienced that this week in how I've slowly approached [[The Ontology of the Human Observer]] and created my own definitions. All of a sudden they hung together and I can recall them.
