Started playing the [[PlayStation 4]] version, knowing that a [[PlayStation 5|PS5]] version was coming out later in 2021.

Rather than pick up the old save which is apparently difficult, I started it again from scratch, hoping some of the story elements make more sense. With these types of games, you can miss something important very easily.

Ultimately a game I couldn't get into though I played enough to appreciate it for a unique and very well crafted game.
