Blogging is a timeline of shared information. It is a conversation between one person and a wider, unknown audience. It is just as valid if the audience is the blogger alone.

## My Relationship with Blogging
I began blogging in the early 2000's using [Radioland](http://radio.userland.com). I met many interesting people online. There was a way to "trackback" and reference the original post when you posted about what another had said. This seems to have fallen away and it's hard to have those conversations.

[[My Decision to Stop Blogging]] has clearly been overturned. I think I've found a way to mix blogging and notes within [[The Quantum Garden]]. My sense is that blogging is sharing the process of live thinking which provides context, and notes are the knowledge that come from that. I have 128 notes that mention "blogging" so there is a hidden importance to delve into. Many discuss my on-again/off-again relationship with the practice. For it is a practice. Some of my struggles have involved:
- Confidentiality
- Habit
- Writing for the wrong audience
- The balance between sharing ideas and sharing instructions with all the background needed to handle that. Maggie's article linked above specifies an assumed audience. I can use that more and assume the knowledge my readers have is what drew them here.
	- "People who have heard of GPT-3 / ChatGPT, and are vaguely following the advances in machine learning, large language models, and image generators. Also people who care about making the web a flourishing social and intellectual space."
