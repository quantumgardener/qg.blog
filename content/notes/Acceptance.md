title: The mood of acceptance
---
The mood of [[Acceptance]] (or [[Acceptance|Peace]]) is one of the strongest [[Basic moods of life]] from which to plan action. Only when we accept the unchangeable for what it is are we able to take a step sideways and move around it. In the image below can be seen a darker turmoil surrounded by a moving and restrictive boundaryâ€”likely [[Resentment]]. In moving through the boundary of "no, it should this way" we find peace.

*We can bounce around inside [[Resentment]] indefinitely until we reach [[Acceptance]] and find a way out.*

Cultivating [[Acceptance]] in our [[Way of Being]] is often the outcome of a negative [[Breakdown]].

[[Acceptance]] does not mean agreement. We can accept the situation and yet still disagree with it. Many changes in the world have come from a position of [[Acceptance]] backed with [[Righteous indignation]]. ^dc3ecb
