*Budding* is a [[Digital garden]] concept, used to mark articles that are published publicly as being more than a [[Seedling]] but not yet [[Evergreen]]. Articles with this maturity are candidates for further development into one or more evergreen notes.

See [[The value of growth maturity in a digital garden is marginal]] for a discussion of why notes are not marked [[Budding]] in this [[Digital garden]].
