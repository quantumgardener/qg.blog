For the last 4-5 years I've used my Sennheiser 4.50BTNC headphones every daty. The BTNC stands for Bluetooth and Noise Cancelling.

Christmas just gone I was gifted a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones. They are two generations newer and a level above the 4.50BTNCs.

Differences: - better fit on the ears - not as tight on the head - wider soundstage - clearer sound - better noise cancelling

They aren't perfect. There are some issues with iOS and the firmware which mean some features have had to be turned off. The automatic on/off when picking up/removing from head are disabled. Otherwise, the bluetooth connection on startup fails. I hope Sennheiser work with Apple to get that fixed.
