I'm almost as divorced from [[Goodreads]] as I can be. I think I'll always have some tie to it because of the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]]. There are only about a dozen books left for me to process.

As far as possible, all my eBooks are now sitting in ePub format within [[Calibre]] and there are placeholders for any [[Audiobooks]], printed books or books I've read for which I don't have an eBook.

There are quite a number of Audiobooks that were on my old US Audible account that I no longer have access to either via my Australian account or the US on. Not notification or option to transfer was ever provided. At some point there will be a huge backlash because [[Digital Rights Management is Unhealthy]].
