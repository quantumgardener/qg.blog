*Backlinks* are links on a web page/note that list other web pages/notes which refer to it. Within my [[digital garden]], backlinks are critical in making connections between ideas. They are important because content does not always flow in one direction and knowing what links to a particular page can create a more informative context or open up new avenues of learning.
