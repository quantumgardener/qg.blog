This concept is an attempt to get people to remember there is more than just the map. Yet, maps show relationships. In the case of a road map, it's the relationships between A and B and importantly how to get there. 

[[Concept mapping]] and [[Map of content]] do the same thing. Provide an abstraction level across the territory of knowledge. 

Maps are important. Expanding the area of my map - removing fog - will help in [[Expanding my comfort zone]].
