I was lucky enough to get an order in from the second round of stock that Amazon had. The PS5 came online at 9:03 am on 12 November 2020 and by 9:11 am they were all gone. That meant I had it delivered in time for Christmas.

## Games

## Hardware
### Internal drive
A [[Samsung 980 Pro SSD 1TB]] has been added as a second internal drive.
### Using the horizontal stand
The instruction guide isn't clear on how to affix the stand. Understanding the instructions at [PS5 stand explained: vertical vs. horizontal orientations, side panels - Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/3/21546315/ps5-stand-vertical-horizontal-side-panels) will make it much more stable.
### HDR Adjustments
The PS5 offers HDR on a 4K screen. These are the recommended adjustments to make.
- Level 15 for screens 1/3 and 2/3, and 0 for 3/3

### Dolby Vision support
The PS5 does not yet support [[Dolby Vision]]. This will be a licensing issue I'm sure as implementation would only require a system software update.
