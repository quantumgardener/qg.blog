The set of actions available for us to take in the moment are a function of our [[Way of Being]]. It impacts directly our ability to communicate and therefore act upon the world to take care of ourselves and others.[^1] 

Since our [[Way of Being]] usually operates silently and invisibly, active learning about our Way of Being and how it may be hindering us is a responsibility we all have. It involves both [[First-order learning]] and [[Second-order learning]]. [[Ontological coaching]] is necessary to help us observe our Way of Being from a place we may not be able to see directly ourselves[^2].
