[[Bob Doto]] argues the [[Literature note]], better called a "reference note"[^1] is a summary of the information found in a source. The literature note serves as a list of the key points the author found interesting and needs a reference back to. It can also serve as a placeholder for thoughts that arise during reading/watching.

Clearly identify the source, use references where possible, and if not possible, keep notes in the order they appear in they are captured. Topical references can be added as they are thought of.

[^1]: I'm sticking with the name "literature note" rather than "reference note" as it is the term I'm hearing for notes taken with respect to a source. Doto is themselves inconsistent and uses "literature note" in other articles (see [[Doto (2022), What is a Permanent Note]]).
