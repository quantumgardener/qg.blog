I’ve written in the past about my preference for newsfeeds to provide the full text of their posts rather than an excerpt that hints at content and requires me to visit a website for the full content (see [[Full Text Please|here]], [[Fully Formed RSS Feeds - The Call is Rising|here]] and [[Quality Excerpts Please|here]]).

19 years on and there are still feeds which only provide an excerpt.

Unless the publishing platform being used prevents a full text feed, the only reason I can think someone would use excepts is to drive traffic to a site to increase hits to increase advertising revenue.

Similar to online newspapers with a paywall.

Maybe I’m naive and believe good writing, shared in full, will bring people to my site to read more. If I’m wrong, then that’s ok with me as I write to prompt thinking in others first and foremost.
