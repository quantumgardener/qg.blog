We spend a large proportion of our lives at work. Once sleep has been factored in , anyone working a 40-hour week commits over a third of their waking hours to the workplace. And that's before the commute. 

**The quality of our work time directly impacts the quality of our lives as humans**. Our humanity is intricately tied to the humanity of those alongside usâ€”those we spend a third of our week with. The lack of humanity in the workplace effects everyone. 

I believe connecting with who we are as individuals is the first step in [[Bringing humanity to the workplace]]. Each of us holds our own [[Way of Being]]. At every moment of the day our [[Way of Being]] influences how we observe the world. The meaning we give our observations dictates the actions we take which include interactions with others. Learning about ourselves is critical to improving our workplaces.

The push to sell more and earn more has cost us our legitimacy. People are chewed up and spat out. Finding the [[Legitimate other]] (and the [[Legitimate self]]) enables [[Conversation for relationship|Conversations for relationships]]. Strong relationships with a shared purpose to care for each other's [[Concernful activity|concerns]] are critical to effective use of [[Conversational technology]]. 
This, I know, is the only way we can generate true change and improvement via our daily work activities. 

Humanity connects us all, and the growth we experience will flow to others and the workplace's [[Organisational Way of Being]] will improve. 

Indicators of [[Humanity in the workplace]] are:
- A sense of self-worth
- Respect for others
- Purposeful conversation
- Emotional well-being and safety
- Meaningful, productive, balanced work
- Learners
