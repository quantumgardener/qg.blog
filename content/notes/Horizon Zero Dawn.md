## Main Game

With [[Horizon Forbidden West]] on the *horizon* later in 2022, I revisited Zero Dawn in order to refamiliarise myself with the lore and gameplay. I've achieved a [[Platinum Trophy]] in 3 years and 11 months since starting and enjoyed getting another 10-15 hours out a game where I'd previously finished the main story line. I think 70-75 hours all up.

Aloy is such an amazing character and great fun to play. Her strength of character as it develops over this game (and subsequent) makes her a true hero and example of leadership.

Even now, when you see someone online easily take down a machine in 90-120 seconds that takes me 5-10 minutes, I have some improving to do.

Aloy in the snow was a challenging addition to the base game.
