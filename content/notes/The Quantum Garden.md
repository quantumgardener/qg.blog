[[The Quantum Garden]] means two things. It refers to my [[Obisidan]] vault where I write and journal, and the online version of my [[Digital Garden]] at https://quantumgardener.info. For more on what that's all about see [[Designing The Quantum Garden]].

https://quantumgardener.blog is historical and mapped to the same site. I may not renew it.
