[[The Quantum Garden]] means two things. It refers to my [[Obisidan]] vault where I write and journal, and the online version of my [[Digital garden]] at https://quantumgardener.info [^1]. For more on what that's all about see [[Designing The Quantum Garden]] and if you are interested in the tech side, [[Hosting The Quantum Garden]].

[^1]: https://quantumgardener.blog is historical and mapped to the same site, rewriting links as needed. I may not renew it.
