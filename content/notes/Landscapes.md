Standing on the edge of the [[Digital garden]] you can see several intriguing landscapes spread out in front of you. Where shall we head first?

The idea of using landscapes fits the visual concept behind a [[Digital garden]] and helps me to broadly organise information. Each landscape it itself a [[Map of content]].

| Landscape                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [[Expand My Way of Being]] | My [[Way of Being]] is more than the behaviour I show. It’s the total sum of how I engage with the world, make meaning from my environment and take action. Expanding my Way of Being by being a learner in the world creates new possibilities for me to move forward in life. |
| [[Hobby Together]]                 | I’m a gamer, a miniature painter, a role-player, a cross-stitcher and enjoyer of good movies and TV at home.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Productive laziness]]       | There is art in doing as much as possible, as easily as possible and that’s what I call being **productive lazy**.                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[The Garden Shed]]               | Every garden needs a good shed, full of the right tools to make it flourish. These are the tools I use.                                                                                                                                                                         |
