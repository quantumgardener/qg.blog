**Burning Shores** is DLC to [[Horizon Forbidden West]] and I finished it on  [[2023-11-26]] after starting it the day before. A great storyline that could easily have been part of the main story it was so well integrated. Starting at level 50, Aloy was simply over-powered and that made it adventurous fun. No complaints at all.
