There is something meditative about sitting there with a controller in hand power washing vehicles, houses and playground equipment. I don't yet understand how it all gets so filthy, but I sure am happy to sit there and clean it all.

The system is perfectly balanced between effort and reward. Each ding and flash of light confirming another piece is clean comes with a pleasing regularity. I feel disappointed when I'm power washing my car and there is silence after a panel or window is finished.
