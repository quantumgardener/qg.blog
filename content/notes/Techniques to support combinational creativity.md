Techniques to support [[Combinational creativity]][^1]:

1. How does A impact B? eg. How does the [[Generation effect]] impact [[Distinction]]?
2. Clustering. What does A and B have in common? Strengthens each idea. 
3. Compare and contrast. How is A similar and different from B (and vice-versa)?

These are similar to the questions put forward in [[The NoMa Method]]. Linking them can be done through [[Map of content|maps of content]] or [[Concept mapping]]. Although [[The map is not the territory]] it is an important guide to my knowledge.

[[Backlinks are important]] in a text tool for identifying previously unseen relationships.
