Lots happening at present and it feels like I'm juggling a lot. Now, the weekend disappeared in a way weekends have never done so before.
## Solar power upgrade
Our 6 old solar panels were replaced on [[2024-11-15|Friday]] with 15 brand new ones giving us a max 6.6 KW output. Initial back of the napkin estimates are payback within 3 years.

Installation took all day Friday with many people drilling holes, climbing into the roof, grinding tiles and generally making noise all day.
## Lost chores
I had a few chores written down for Saturday. The day went without me looking at the list. Something is telling me I really need those 3 week's leave I have booked at Christmas.
## Home nurse
My [[Wendy Buchan|wife]] has been ill today so I've been looking after her for most of it. Not that I did much other than painkillers and liquids.
## Photos
Once again pushing to get photos cataloged in [[Mediabank]]. I'm now complete up to April 2024. 
## Gaming
Started my second play through of [[The Last of Us Part II]], but found I needed to put that aside for the easier to manage [[LEGO Star Wars - The Skywalker Saga]]. 8/9 movies done. I thought about going for the [[Platinum trophy]] and have since discounted that. The completion chase will be too much time on repeat despite the fun I'm having along the way. I have other things to do with my lifeâ€”like yesterday's chores!
