Today [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) joins my toolbox of categorising and storing information for later retrieval. Normally I would use  [[PersonalBrain]] for that purpose but it doesn't allow me to share links with others in my community. On the other hand del.icio.us doesn't enable parent/child relationships.

There has been a flurry of online tools which use [tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tags) to categorise content. I like tags but wish I could use them for everything rather than just photos or webpages. I have found that using other's tags can be useful for consistency but the variance and volume still makes it difficult to get serious value from them. I keep to myself with a first-and-foremost view that the tool has to support my knowledge management before it supports everyone else.

Will I move everything to del.icio.us? Time will tell.
