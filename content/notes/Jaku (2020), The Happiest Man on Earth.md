As I walked outside with with my ham, cheese and relish rolls, and my [[Kindle Scribe]], I said to my wife, "I need to find a new book to read." 90 minutes later I'd finished lunch and this amazing holocaust story from a man who lived to 101.

Eddie, my new friend[^1], tells of internment in multiple concentration camps and travel across Europe doing all that was necessary to survive. Technically the book is an easy read. Emotionally, it's poignant and serves to get across the message that family, friends and love are what we need to be happy.

[^1]: Read the book and you'll understand why.
