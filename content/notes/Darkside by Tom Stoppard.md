![[mu_darkside.webp|200]]

Commissioned by the BBC for the 40th Anniversary of *[[Dark Side of the Moon]]*, I first heard this radio play around 2015 and only the once. It was pulled from [[Spotify]] not long after. Every now and then I'd look for it on streaming to no avail. 

So, I finally ponied up the money and ordered a copy from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) where I've had success finding some [[Dodo & the Dodos]] CDs. The disc came with a book containing the script and words, plus another disc of multilingual translations as PDF files.

I think Darkside is a near perfect blending of the music of Pink Floyd with a conversation about moral philosophy and is certain to be listened to many times more.
