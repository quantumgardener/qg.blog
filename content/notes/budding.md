**Budding** is a [[digital garden]] concept, used to mark articles that are published publicly as being more than a [[seedling]] but not yet [[evergreen]]. Articles with this maturity are candidates for further development into one or more evergreen notes.

See [[The Value of Growth Maturity in a Digital Garden is Marginal]] for a discussion of why notes are not marked [[budding]] in this [[digital garden]].
