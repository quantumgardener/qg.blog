Another big day after [[Cybercon (2024), Day One|yesterday]] at [[Cybercon (2024)|Cybercon]]. Sore feet after walking so far, and in new shoes, so it will be room service tonight.

[Geoffrey Robertson KC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Robertson) opened the day with an entertaining talk that covered everything from *Deep Throat* to the threat of AI and the complete inability of international law to protect us against AI misuse.

The sessions I attended were themed around development of Cyber Incident Response Plans and the care of the mental health of cyber's front-line responders. I've applied some [[Combinational creativity]] and built out an exciting picture of an expansive CIRP which benefits from including others beyond IT. I am looking forward to the conversations I'll have in that space with others since I've already started. It's not everyday you can say you're happy to chat with a lawyer and a psychologist. 

My strategy for meeting people has been deliberate and was learned from [[Roy Sheppard]] many years ago. If you are by yourself, find others who are by themselves. It is [super easy, and barely an inconvenience](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Super%20Easy%2C%20Barely%20an%20Inconvenience) to enter a conversation with, "Hi, how are you finding the conference?" One person was reading *[[The Lies of Locke Lamora]]* (which I recommended) and we entered into a long conversation about [[Brandon Sanderson]] and [[Atlas/Notes/People/Mark Lawrence]] as authors. A student new to the field did the same to me and we discussed what his career in software development might look like and the general applicability of university training.

Moving quickly from room to room had me thinking I was back in school moving between classes. The me of back then would not imagine the conference of today.
