FOMO generates extra dollars for the gaming industry, both PC/console gaming and board/tabletop games.

Two words. DLC and Expansion.

Both represent additions to the base game. The call is strong. After a conversation last night with a friend about this very point I learned there is an expansion to SmallWorld I didn’t know about, and there are some expansions for [[Sid Meier's Civilization VI]] that I don’t have.

Immediately, I want to buy them. Knowing full well I’ll never use them.

I’m not the only one.
