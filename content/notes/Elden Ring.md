This is the game everyone has been talking about and playing. Rarely do I see anyone I know playing the same game as me, at the same time. Now, 5-6 at a time are playing Elden Ring.

Me? Getting to grips with it. Lots of muscle memory to unlearn regarding key combinations. A dozen times now I've summoned my mount and them immediately dismissed it.

[[2022-05-07]] - over 30 hours in now and still wandering around trying to work out what's going in. Had a good day today. Have certainly improved my character's abilities. Took down the Tree Sentinel on my 4th go and Flying Dragon Agheel on my first, with just shield and sword. The big boss Godrick the Grafted is my next target. After 10-15 goes the best I had him down to was 20% health. I need a bit more in the tank.

[[Now, 19 March 2023]] - putting this game aside again after quite a bit of time the past 2 weeks. 85 hours in and I'm not sure what I'm doing. Proud of my effort so far and I like to think I can complete it, but practically too much investment against all the other games I'd like to be playing.

## Road to Platinum
### Legendary armaments
- [x] Grafted BladeGreatsword
	- Morne's Castle - Morne Moangrave grace Site. Defeat the Area boss (Leonine Misbegotten).
- [x] Sword of Night and Flame
	- Luiria - Carian Manor. From the **Manor Upper-level** grace spot in **Carian manor**, make your way out to where the bridges are and cross two of them heading to the NE and turn right on the only bridge you can, then drop down from the next bridge on the building below, you should see a small break on the ground just above the building you can drop down onto. Make your way onto the next drop down from there and head down the ladder to a chest containing this Legendary weapon.
- [ ] Ruins Greatsword 
	- Caelid - Redmane Castle. This weapon will be the reward for a boss fight that involves a misbegotten warrior and a crucible knight when you enter Redmane castle for the first time. If you arrive here later after you have already reached Altus plateau, there will be a festival going on instead. To circumvent this speak to the jester and he should give you an option to return back to before the festival to fight the two minibosses so you are able to claim this weapon. After you triumph over the two mini-bosses you will be rewarded this sword.
- [ ] Marias Executioners Sword
	- Altus Plateau - Shaded Castle. The reward for defeating ![Bronze](https://psnprofiles.com/lib/img/icons/buttons/bronze.png "Bronze")  [Elemer of the Briar](https://psnprofiles.com/guide/14008-elden-ring-trophy-guide#40-elemer-of-the-briar).
- [ ] Darkmoon Greatsword
	- The reward for completing Ranni's questline: Please refer to ![Gold](https://psnprofiles.com/lib/img/icons/buttons/gold.png "Gold")  [Age of the Stars](https://psnprofiles.com/guide/14008-elden-ring-trophy-guide#6-age-of-the-stars) trophy on how to complete Ranni's questline which will end with you getting this legendary weapon.
- [ ] Bolt of Gransax ==MISSABLE==
	- Leyndell, the Capital. This weapon is located ON the giant spear that has pierced the dead dragon. Make your way from the Godfrey boss Encounter, head down the stairs into the next area, take the elevator down and walk along the railing to a small ledge below which is directly in front of the spear itself. You'll know you're near because there is a crucible knight patrolling the walkway where you need to drop down. After you drop down hop on to the spear and walk all the way up to the glowing orange soul to claim your legendary weapon. **NOTE***** this weapon is missable on your first playthrough if you burn the Erd tree before claiming this weapon as the city will fill with ash and will cover the weapon making it impossible to claim. You can enter NG+ and speed to this area and claim the weapon to get the trophy.**
- [ ] Eclipse Shotel
	- Castle Sol.   After fighting your way through Castle sol this weapon is located in **The Church of the Eclipse.**
- [ ] Devourer's Scepter ==BUGGY==
	- You can get this item in two stages of the game.  
		- Stage 1: Beginning of the game head to the Warmaster's shack and kill the Warmaster he will drop this legendary weapon.  
		- Stage 2: In **Farum Azula**, near the **great bridge grace point**, heading down to collect the legendary talisman, you will be invaded by the "Warmaster" himself as another name after you kill him he will drop this weapon along with the Bloody Wolf armor set and another weapon alongside it. This will only happen if you have gone through his mini-quest as a part of the Volcano Manor side quest where you receive a few envelopes that contain "marks" you need to kill. He will invade after you finish those marks in this sidequest. This weapon is marked as buggy because it's still unconfirmed on whether killing Maliketh the black blade will void his invasion making this weapon unobtainable if you neglected to kill him at his shack earlier in the game.
- [ ] Golden Order Greatsword
	- Hidden Path to the Haligtree - **Cave of the Forlorn**. This weapon is located SE of Ordina, Liturgical town grace point, and just south of the first large tree on the map along the frozen riverbank. Make your way through the mini-dungeon to the bottom where you will fight another Misbegotten enemy that is wielding this sword. After killing him he will drop this legendary sword.

### Legendary Ashen Remains
- [ ] Redmane Knight Ogha (Archer summon with gravity arrows, sword, and shield in close combat tanky with AOE)
	- **Starscourge Radahn Grace point** After beating Radahn, from his grace point go to the northernmost part of the massive battlefield, there will be a door you can open to explore a mini-dungeon, beat the boss of this mini-dungeon to claim these legendary ashen remains.
- [ ] Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff (Spear and greatshield, can cast lightning attacks, Very tanky)
	- **Sainted Hero's Grave** - Altus Plateau Region. Fight your way through the Sainted Hero's Grave and after beating the boss of this dungeon you will obtain these legendary ashen remains.
- [ ] Lhutel the Headless (Death on his lance, but it doesn't affect PVE enemies. Tanky and a decent choice for a summon but others are much better)
	- **Tombsward Catacombs** - southern limgrave just above the Erd Tree Minor. Fight your way through this dungeon and after beating the boss you will obtain these legendary ashen remains.
- [ ] Cleanrot Knight Finlay (good damage with holy disc ranged attack. Can apply scarlet rot to enemies. Not good for tanking but has decent damage with less than decent evasiveness)
	- **Elpheal, Brace of the Haligtree** - Prayer room grace point. From the prayer room grace point walk through the door and head down 3 sets of stairs and hop over the ledge to find a Red orb dung beetle flying in the air, just to the left there's a doorway with a knight guarding the door, and a Rot Knight guarding a chest inside. Take them both out and claim these legendary ashen remains from the chest inside the room
- [ ] Black Knifhe Tiche (Quick elusive assassin that can dodge most attacks, kind of squishy at taking damage but can usually avoid most attacks from enemies)
	- **Ringleaders Evergaol** - Near Moonlight Altar Grace Point in Liurnia. These ashen remains require you to pretty much complete Ranni's quest chain to gain access to the hidden area up top on the cliffs in Liurnia. Once you're about 90% done with the quest chain you will gain access to this area. After you enter make your way to the far left of the area to find an Evergaol, enter it and fight the Black Knife Assassin to claim this legendary ashen remains.
- [x] Mimic Tear Ashes (A complete replica of yourself, comes with everything you have equipped when you summon them, including weapons, talismans, armor, items, and spells **best summon in the game**)
	- **Ancestral Woods -** Nokstella the Eternal City. Fight your way around the area of Ancestral woods and look out for an Imp-locked door, use 2 swordstone keys to unlock this door, and enter inside to find a chest in a room filled with statues. Open it to find the Legendary ashen remains.

## Beginner Tips
- [Elden Ring: How to Summon Spirits - VGKami](https://vgkami.com/elden-ring-how-to-summon-spirits/) - needs to be at night
- Parrying
	- Need a shield with Ash of War Parry attached. Can purchase at Woarmaster's Shack near the start if I don't have it. 
	- Easier to parry with a smaller shield. Buckler sheild is the easiest.
	- Watch hands. Initiate parry on start of forward swing.
	- Riposte is a crit. Daggers do lots of damage on criticals.
	- Golden Parry or Carian Retaliation with Medium Shield is as good.
		- Golden Parry gives longer parry distance, but with FP cost
		- Carian Retalition only has FP cost when taking spells. Less range, but has to be cast.
