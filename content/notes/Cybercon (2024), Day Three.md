Most delegates and vendors were tired after [[Cybercon (2024), Day One|Day One]], [[Cybercon (2024), Day Two|Day Two]], and a couple of parties (which I wasn't at).

Today's main ideas were:
- Generative AI is here to stay and not a fad. I didn't think it was temporary but wasn't across the huge amount bricks and mortar investment into data centres, and AI related Physics and Chemistry Nobel prizes. The Age of Intelligence is here.
- When caring for data, you can act ethically yet be illegal, or be legal and unethical. Meeting minimum standards for data protection will make you legal, but you are likely unethical if that's all you have.
- AI counter-intelligence and weaponry is always making assumptions and it's impossible to correct it with the knowledge that its decisions are right or wrong. 

Thanks to all the presenters. Maybe I'll be up there with you next year. I can think of several useful perspectives I could add to what I've seen.

There is a passionate community of cyber security professionals here in Australia and around the world. They are on the front line of protecting you against cyber threats from bad actors across the globe. Each experiences days on end that will lead to burnout. Legislation is still behind where it needs to be as is board level understanding and investment. Putting dollars ahead of a balanced security program leads to breaches of customer data which is bad. Penalising that company out of existence and removing the service they provided adds more bad to the pile.
