I lost the weekend. My plan was to write more than I managed (zero plus this post) and I never got there. On Friday morning I was at the gym for a personal trainer supported workout. I want to improve my general strength. The workout was a challenge, and to be fair to the PT, I wasn't pushed. I've paid for it since with sore arms and torso. Typing hasn't been the issue. The lack of concentration caused by the pain has. It is now easing.

Also on Friday morning I watched [a video on internal monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO0q-RvXrBo) which created some interesting [[Distinction|Distinctions]]. I would have said I have a strong internal monologue but after listening to the talk my thoughts have changed. It is astonishingly difficult to know how we think until we receive some coaching. Despite that, there was enough in the conversation for me to adjust my perception. Not all of my thoughts are word based.

Segue into the next piece. I'm having some trouble with getting thoughts on paper for [[Humanity in the workplace]]. I can't translate what is in my mind. Now, I suspect it's because the thoughts are no so much words and are more images and feeling.
