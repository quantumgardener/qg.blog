I didn't have too much interest in this game when it was first released late 2020. And serious issues with performance on the [[PlayStation 4|PS4]] with no [[PlayStation 5|PS5]] version in sight until Feb 2022 kept me from gaining any interest.

With the [[PlayStation 5|PS5]] release there was a 5-hour free trial and the game at 1/4 the price what it would have been at release.

Completed the trial and have then purchased. Means I have chosen to leave off [[Horizon Forbidden West]] at least until I finish the main story.

The game's checkpoints are poor, forcing me through whole sequences of travel or dialogue that add no value for a second (third, fourth...) helping and only serve as a punishment.

And as of [[2022-03-06]] I've given up on the game. Close to the finish, but with a 4-5 minute penalty for not breaking into a compound, I can't be bothered anymore. The pay off isn't there.
