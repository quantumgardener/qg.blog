Digital knowledge comes at us in all forms and it can be a challenge to manage. This note describes how I manage information in my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system.

## Knowledge and Records
It has taken many iterations of many systems to realise there is a difference between knowledge and records.

| Knowledge                            | Records                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Created by me                        | Created by others                   |
| Date is unimportant                  | Point in time, usually dated        |
| Connected to other knowledge         | Each record is complete unto itself |
| Difficult to organise in a hierarchy | Easy to organise in a hierarchy     |
Examples of records include:
- Letters
- Certificates
- Receipts
- Tax records
- Operating Manuals
- Results

Knowledge is pretty much everything else in my system. And because knowledge and records are so different, I need complimentary tools.

## Storing Records
Records are stored in [[Zotero]], within a folder structure ("Collections") that follow my [[Johnny.Decimal]] index. More on that below.

![[Zotero Johnny Decimal Collection Structure.webp]]

The screenshot above shows some of the categories within [[Zotero]]. There are gaps because not every index item has documents associated with it. A Zotero collection is only created when needed.

> [!INFO] Benefits of Zotero for storing records:
> - Metadata can be added. I typically set a Date and a tag such as Receipt.
> - Documents can exist in multiple collections. In the back-end of the system documents are stored independently from their mapping to a collection. This is quite different from a filesystem directory structure where documents exist in only one location.
> - Zotoro runs as a WebDAV server on my [[Synology DiskStation DS920+]] so I can access it from multiple computers in the house.
