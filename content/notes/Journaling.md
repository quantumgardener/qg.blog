There are many reasons to journal.

- Capture historical information

- Process thoughts and feelings
	- - [[When in Doubt, List it Out]]
- [[Self-Authoring]] through understanding life's events and their part in your [[story]].

	- [[How to Journal (Like a Philosopher)]]

I vary between all three styles. Historical capture is important. When I'm stressed I turn to journaling to process information and try to regain control. My use for [[Self-Authoring]] has been limited.

I originally kept paper journals and have slowly progressed in transferring them to digital content. All new journaling is all digital. There are benefits in linking and searching that overcome the risk thought is too quick. Truthfully, I haven't found the speed of typing an issue. When I feel the need to slow I do.

There is a common theme of having a regular structure to work to. That may be:
- Standard prompt questions
- List of questions for a particular purpose/time of year/focus
