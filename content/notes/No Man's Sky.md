**No Man's Sky** is a space exploration game, notorious for a horrible launch where the developer's game play promises were not met, and its redemption over time into a really good and well developed game. 

It's similar to [[Elite - Dangerous]] inasmuch as it involves flying through space but whereas Elite is centred on trade, exploration and combat, No Man's Sky is much stronger on planet exploration and crafting.

I enjoy No Man's Sky as it's easier to jump into than Elite and there is a story line involved that pulls me along. 

The [[Platinum trophy]] for this was troublesome. Both the [The Longest Voyage](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/5155-no-mans-sky/9-the-longest-voyage) for 40 warp jumps and [Stranger in a Strange Land](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/5155-no-mans-sky/14-stranger-in-a-strange-land) for survival hours trophies were missed even though I had passed the criteria for them. In the first case I even had the trophy for 75 jumps but not the one for 40! Additionally I was getting crashes after a time. The solution was go to back to an earlier save file and repeat. Some rework but not as much as starting a game from scratch.
