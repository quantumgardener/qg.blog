The whole family is on [[Spotify]] for our music streaming[^1]

## Mobile Play of Out-of-Catalogue Items
I have some old CDs and some which will never be on a streaming service. Playing them in the house via the desktop app is not a problem. The CDs have been ripped to flac format using [fre:ac](https://www.freac.org) and are stored in my Windows Music folder for easy access and recognition by [[Spotify]]. Getting them to mobile has proven to be an exercise in frustration. Overly complicated. It took me a couple of hours to get working.
1. Spotify Desktop: Settings | Your Library | Show Local Files = On
2. Spotify Desktop: Settings | Show songs from | Music Library = Off. Recommended for while you set up and test otherwise there are duplicates and Spotify does not let you know if you are looking at a .flac or .mp3 version of a file.
3. Create a new folder outside of the Windows Music folder for MP3 versions of my files. Mine is called Spotify Music.
4. Spotify Desktop: Settings | Show songs from | Add a source - select the folder created in the previous step.
5. Spotify Desktop: Create a playlist for each album you want to transfer to your mobile device. This playlist can be anywhere in your hierarchy. If you already have a playlist for the .flac files you will need another.
6. Spotify iOS: Settings | Local Files | Show audio files from this device = On. I'm not 100 sure if this is required, but it helps you see which files are actually on your device. Although you can control playback on another device for .flac files, you can't play them on your mobile.
7.  Spotify iOS: Allow access to local network devices. You can set this via the iOS settings for Spotify later if you missed it or don't get prompted.
8. Spotify iOS: Go to the playlist you want and download it. Repeat for all other albums.

You can now play the out of catalogue items on your mobile.

> [!TIP] If you have added the .flac file to a playlist it will appear to download OK, but won't actually be there to play.


[^1]: I tried to move us to [[Apple Music]] as a cheaper option. The combined package of extra storage, and Apple TV+, which we were already paying for, along with Apple Music was cheaper overall than a [[Spotify]] subscription. Apple Music had the advantage of allowing me to upload my own music. I can do this with Spotify as described above, but it is far messier.
