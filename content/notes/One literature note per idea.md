Ahrens[^1], and others[^2], prefer to create a separate [[Literature note]] for each idea they find relevant in the source. This dramatically slows up the initial reading process and offloads the [[Literature note]] function to [[Fleeting note|fleeting notes]] resulting in more notes than useful.

When [[One literature note per idea]] is followed each [[Literature note]] is an [[Atomic note]].
