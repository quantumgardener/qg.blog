[[Map of content|Maps of content]] can take any form necessary to assist with the organisation of data.

1. The default storage location for a [[Map of content]] is `\Atlas\Maps` in accordance with the design principles of the [[ACE Framework]]. For items published on [[The Quantum Garden]] the path is `Quartz\maps`.
2. All [[Map of content|maps of content]] are tagged `#map` irrespective of where they are stored.
3. The [[Home Life Index]] is a special [[Map of content]] that organises information with in the [[Johnny.Decimal]] system. Notes within its hierarchy are not tagged `#map`.
4. Maps may be stored in other locations if that makes more sense but should generally be avoided. Some will be contextual with the knowledge they are mapping. It may make more sense to tag a Map with `#map` in-situ rather than tag and move it.
