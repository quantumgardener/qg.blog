title: The map is not the territory
---
All maps are an abstraction of the territory they represent. Reliance on the map as [[The truth]] risks missing the whole picture[^1]. Learn [[How to read a map]]. 

Maps assist with the cognitive understanding of a territory. The map my be a close representation (road map) or logical abstraction and reordering ([London Underground Tube map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_map)).

Maps may contain errors, either in the map itself, or the way it is interpreted. The case of driving off a cliff could be one or both. 

All [[Mental model|Mental models]] are a kind of map and so subject to the same considerations describe here. In my [[Digital garden]] they are often synonymous.

The ideal map would contain the map itself, and a map of the map of the map[^1]. Even at 1:1 scale this is not possible[^2].

[[Concept mapping]] and [[Mind mapping|Mind maps]] are types of maps in the [[Knowledge management]] and [[Personal knowledge management|PKM]] spaces where they abstract high level concepts to guide learning. [[Map of content|Maps of content]] help organise information.

Maps are important. Expanding the area of my map of life and knowledge—removing fog— will help in [[Expanding my comfort zone]].
