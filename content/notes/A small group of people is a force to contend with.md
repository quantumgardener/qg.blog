I came across this quote in [Presence](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/ 0974239011) and was powerfully struck by its relevance to a conversation I had had a few days before. [Nick Hanauer](http://www.secondave.com/nick.htm), a past board member of [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com) is quoted as saying...

> "When asked about the role of intention in his entrepreneurial experience, Hanauer said, "There's no doubt about the value of being irretrievably committed to something. One of my favorite sayings, attributed to [Margaret Mead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead), has always been 'Never doubt that a small group of committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.' I totally believe it. You could do almost anything with just five people. With only one person, it's hard—but when you put that one person with four or five more, you have a force to content with. All of a sudden, you have enough momentum to make almost anything that's immanent, or within reach, actually real. I think that's what entrepreneurship is all about— creating that compelling vision and force". [[Presence](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974239011), p.134]
