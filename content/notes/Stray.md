![[vg_Stray.webp]]

A game where I get to play as a cat.

With 2 cats in the house, have to say it's animated very realistically.

## Catinum Trophy
I have the [[Platinum Trophy]] on *Stray.*  It took an effective three play throughs. 

I finished the main story a little over a week ago and have spent a couple of evenings and some time today cleaning up the remainder of the trophies.

I enjoyed the trophy cleanup more than the game. That is mostly because my first play through was a stop-gap fill between *[[God of War Ragnarök]]* and *[[Forspoken]]*. I was also able to hoon around my little kitty-cat faster than when trying to solve puzzles.

The last trophy was a speed run. Two hours to complete the game. I finished with just 6m 39s remaining on the clock.

> _Stray_ is my [11th Platinum trophy](https://psnprofiles.com/Quantum-Gardener/log?type=platinum)[^1] and the second this year. Trophy names are usually puns and [many of the _Stray_ trophies are](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/17011-stray/Quantum-Gardener). They missed out by calling the last “All Done” and not “Catinum”.

[^1]:	*[[Ghost of Tsushima]]* was first achieved on the [[PlayStation 4]] and then it popped on the [[PlayStation 5]] as well so I don’t count that amongst the 11.
