Ordered [[2021-03-07]], arrived [[2021-03-29]].

The binoculars weight 2.1kg.

## Accessories
### Tripod
The tripod I first settled on was a Benro Slim Aluminium Video Tripod with S2 Head and [QR4 Quick Release Plate](https://www.rubbermonkey.com.au/Benro-QR4-Slide-In-Video-Quick-Release-Plate-for-S2-Video-Head), however it was too short. I received a Neewer Professional Tripod for Fathers' Day 2022 which is taller. Swapped the heads around to get the best of both worlds.

### Case
[Sirius Optics Case Aluminium Large - Sirius Optics](https://www.sirius-optics.com.au/sirius-optics-case-aluminium-large.html) 

### Spotting
It may be worth getting a red dot finder for easier spotting at night. All from the USA it seems which is not ideal.
