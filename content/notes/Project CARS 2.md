Purchased on eBay second hand for $22.

I've been enjoying the game. More "realistic" than [[Gran Turismo Sport]] but on a controller I'm finding it very had to get consistency lap after lap, no matter how I concentrate. I've adjusted the steering sensitivity and that's helped. There is not much travel in a controller stick, so therefore steering requires an amazing amount of precision. LIttle movements have big effects, no matter how sensitive the steering is. Millimeters compared to centimeters (or 10's of centimeters) on  the diameter of a wheel.

If only they weren't so expensive.

...I now have a [[Thrustmaster T300 RS GT]] wheel.

Still, this game is more simcade racing than sim-racing. My preferred go to race game is [[Assetto Corsa Competizione]].
