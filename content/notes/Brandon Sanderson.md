What a writer. My first read of Brandon was the *[[Mistborn Trilogy]]* and from there I moved to *[[The Stormlight Archive]]* and despite each book in that series being 1000+ pages, I read the first 4 back-to-back.

I've read all 7 Mistborn books released so far.

Recently I began listening to the Stormlight Archive audiobooks. Amazing to recognise how much foreshadowing there was which I was not aware of.
