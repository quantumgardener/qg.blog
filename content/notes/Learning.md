[[Learning]] is the acquisition of skills and knowledge. The more we learn the more options become available. If we adjust our actions and behaviour accordingly, we have more power in life.

A domain of [[Learning]] is our [[Way of Being]], especially when engaged in [[Second-order learning]] instead of [[First-order learning]], and is called [[Ontological learning]].

If we [[Let the mental models of the world teach me]] our perspective will broaden.
