[[Learning]] is the acquisition of skills and knowledge. The more we learn the more we are able to take different actions in life. Options give us power.

A domain of [[Learning]] is our [[Way of Being]], especially when engaged in [[Second-order learning]] instead of [[First-order learning]], and is called [[Ontological learning]].
