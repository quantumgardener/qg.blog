I'm primarily an [observational blogger](https://quantumgardener.blog/2022/01/27/types-of-bloggers/) when [[Blogging]]. Throughout the day I'll notice something and think, "I wonder if that's an example of..." and I'll use it as the prompt to share what I've observed.

There are three reasons for this.

1. Writing helps my solidify my observations
2. Observing helps be become better at understanding what's working for me and what isn't
3. It prompts thinking in other readers such as yourself.

Of course, there are other [[Types of Bloggers]].
