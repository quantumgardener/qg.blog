In my day-to-day interactions with people I use [[Types of conversation]] to maximise the effectiveness of the conversation. The concept of conversational types is grounded in the work of [[Fernando Flores]].

These multiple types of conversation are:
- [[Conversation for stories and assessments]]: conversations that share experiences or your understanding of what has happened.
- [[Conversation for clarity]]: this note is a conversation for clarity about [[Types of conversation]]. Clarity is at its heart about creating shared understanding of knowledge and meaning.
- [[Conversation for coordination of action]]: typically planning meetings where the objective is to understand everybody's role on the team. "You do this. I'll do that".
- [[Conversation for speculation or possible action]]: brainstorming, scenario planning.
- [[Conversation for possible conversations]]: a simple form but often necessary to set up a conversation at a later date. Usually of the form "Lets meet on Monday to have a conversation for clarity about..."
- [[Conversation for relationship]]: conversations that build shared experience with others and improve your relationship.
- [[Conversation for appreciation or complaint]]: predominantly of the latter form, this type of conversation is all about feedback.
- [[Conversation for second order learning]]: reflective conversations in which we learn about our [[Way of Being]]. 

Too often, especially in meetings, the conversation jumps from mode to mode and nothing is achieved. By knowing which type of conversation you are entering (or wish to create) you are able to increase the chance the objective of the conversation will be met.

[[Knowledge management benefits from directed conversation]].
