2024 has been a year for me to learn about how I work and where I get my energy from.

I like being creative and bringing together ideas from multiple disciplines. But it takes time and energy so I can't do it all the time, or fast. It has to come to me.

I like doing organisation work, even if it is in danger of falling into [[The optimisation-procrastination trap]]. There is a meditative aspect which helps me achieve balance.

I like creating with clients more than I realised. That is a balance between soaking up new ideas and connecting them to my experience in interesting ways.

In all cases I can only do so much of one style of work in a day. If I only have one to work with, I will get tired quickly. Swapping tasks is important in how I keep the energy up. If I only have one a week, or predominantly one style without a deadline driving me, I end up feeling like shit.
