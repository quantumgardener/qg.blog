> [!NOTE]- Band of Brothers: Episode 7 - The Breaking Point.
> Get your hands on this if you wish to see a moving story of leadership against the perils of war. War stories typically portray leadership of the "Do this, do that" variety. Chain of command and all that. This particular episode deals with Easy Company and what they face when their leader is completely and utterly ineffective. It shows leadership from multiple angles, official and unofficial. And importantly it shows the nature of followership as well. What do the natural leaders do when their men and putting down the official leader? What to the military leaders do when the chain of command is a chain around their actions.
> The climax of the story was the most powerful moment for me in the whole series. When the wrong decisions are made by the wrong leaders men die.
