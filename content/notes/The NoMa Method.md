The NoMa Method reminds me of the framework of questions used in a coaching conversation.

"NoMa" stands for Note Making, contrasted to Note Taking. I learned of it from [[Nick Milo]].

It's similar because it is structured to pull out [[Distinction|Distinctions]] and a way forward. 

It's different because the focus is on note making and not inquiry into [[Way of Being]].

That's important because there may be other such constructs I can discover and use to my advantage. My [[Universal Map of Concepts]] is the way I'm currently linking everything together, but what else is there?
