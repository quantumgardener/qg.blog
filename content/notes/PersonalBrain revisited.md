I have just started integrating [[PersonalBrain]] into my personal knowledge management toolset - again. A year ago I couldn't get away from hierarchical organisation and found I was remembering where things were; rather than letting the tool do it for me. Then I discovered [Topic Maps](http://www.topicmaps.org/) and further limitations became clear. [[PersonalBrain]] does not allow for role designations on the associations between topics as Topic Maps do.

However, this time around I'm armed with knowledge. The combined postings on the [PersonalBrain Yahoo! group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ personalbrain/) contained several hints and tips that have made the tool much easier to use. I suggest that anybody who has looked at [[PersonalBrain]] take a look at the group for further guidance to that provided in the manual. [Jerry Michalski's site](http://www.sociate.com/) in particular has a great [set of rich examples](http://www.sociate.com/My_Brain/Brain2/brain2.shtml).

Why did I go back to[[ PersonalBrain]]? Frustration at trying to manage everything on my hard drive and the Internet. So far, this time around it looks to be working well.
