> **Nagash**, known by many names such as the _**Great Necromancer**_, the _**Great Betrayer**_, the _**Usurper**_, the _**Undying King**_, the _**Supreme Lord of Undeath**_ or simply _**He Who Shall Not Be Named**_, is the ultimate personification of death and the undead, an ancient, evil being who sought to conquer this cruel, chaotic world and bring about an age of undeath that will rule for all eternity. Nagash is darkness and unreasoning hatred given form, the father and creator of foul necromancy and lord of allvampire-kind. His every action and deeds is self-serving, his achievement horrific and loathsome, and his every whim are bent solely to ensure that no one shall ever deny nor challenge his right to rule ever again.[^1]

To me, Nagash is a Warhammer "miniature" that took me over two years to complete. The challenges were the size of the model itself, and somewhere to paint. The desk that I had, where I could just sit and paint when I wanted, was co-opted to my COVID home office. That meant it took several minutes to set up and tear down my painting environment each time and often I couldn't be bothered. With some holidays in hand I pushed on to the finish.
