There is something about the wireframe graphics, space and trading that made this game amazing. I have a clear image of it on a screen [[118 Maple Street, Golden Square, VIC, Australia|in the bedroom of the house of my teenage years]].

Most of my commentary on the game is on the more recent and advanced [[Elite - Dangerous|Elite: Dangerous]].
