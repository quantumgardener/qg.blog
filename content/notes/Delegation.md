[[Delegation]] is a [[Conversation for coordination of action]] where one person, the delegator, is making a [[Requests|Request]] of the delegate.

Delegation typically occurs because:
- We do not have the time to perform the task ourselves
- We do not have the skill to perform the task ourselves
- It is not our responsibility to complete the task, but it is our responsibility to ensure it is completed
- We could do it, but are developing the skill in others
- We're just lazy

It is vital to [[Think before you delegate]] and ensure you provide the context, constraints and resources necessary to your delegate.
