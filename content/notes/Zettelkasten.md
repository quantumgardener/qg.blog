A [[Zettelkasten]] is a collection of interconnected notes to create new meaning across domains and concepts. 

The [[Zettelkasten]] most referenced is the paper version developed by [[Niklas Luhrmann]]. 

Digital note-taking tools, with [[Backlink|backlinks]] make the creation of a Zettelkasten system easier but there is still a need for discipline.
