title: Starting to bring humanity to the workplace
---
The early stages of describing [[Humanity in the workplace]] have been penned. I will refine the note as I write more on supporting topics and begin to link other notes. I'd love to have everything in place today, but that's only slightly, completely unrealistic. Fog obscures some of the route even with the destination clearly in sight. I feel the importance of this in my body and emotions more than in my words and therein lies the challenge at this early stage.

Still, I am content with this start and the discipline of publishing something before 9am. The next piece of work is to re-jig my site's home page and work out if I can allow commenting. No rush. I'm on holidays after all and can now spend the remainder of the day as I see fit. Mostly photo editing (learning to use a drawing tablet along the way) and keyword improvements in [[Mediabank]].
