My 2022 reading stats are in and this year I clocked 20,871 over 46 books. Since first purchasing a Kindle some years ago my reading has increased substantially, and my annual target is 20,000 pages.

My new favourite author is [[Brandon Sanderson]]. 9/46 books were authored by him, and approx. 7,000 pages. There were two series involved. _[[The Stormlight Archive]]_ and books 4-7 of _[[The Mistborn Saga]]_. I didn't know it when I started, but the two series are related as both exist in his world, the Cosmere.

10/46 books were the new audiobook recordings from Terry Pratchett's _[[Discworld]]_. These are high quality and super-enjoyable.

I count audiobooks in my reading for the year. No doubt some will argue they are not reading in the proper sense. I think they are, and given each is at least 3x the duration to listen to as it takes me to read, I'm counting the effort.

The surprise books for the year were _[[Mythos]]_, _[[Heroes]]_ and _[[Troy]]_ by [[Stephen Fry]]. I had read Mythos before. It's more palatable as an audiobook. I also enjoyed the first two books in the _[[Millennium]] Series_ being _[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]_ and _[[The Girl Who Played With Fire]]_.

Worst book? _[[The Magicians]]_ by a long way. In fact, it's one of the least enjoyable books I've ever read. To me it felt, derivative, and pointless.
