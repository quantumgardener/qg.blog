*Backlinks* are links on a web page/note that list other web pages/notes which refer to it. Within my [[Digital garden]], backlinks are critical in making connections between ideas. The most useful are [[To be useful backlinks must be automatically generated|automatically generated]].

[[Backlinks are important]] because content does not always flow in one direction and knowing what links to a particular page can create a more informative context or open up new avenues of learning.

[[Backlinks are not hierarchical]] and can end up creating circular references which is perfectly ok.
