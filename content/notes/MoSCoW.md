[[MoSCoW]] is a [[Mental model]] enduring critical items get the focus they need organised around the minimum we need to deliver.

**M** ust have
**O**
**S** hould have
**C** could have
**O**
**W** on't have (this time)

Must have no more than 60% of effort available. 20% for should have, 20% for could have. Good way for fixed price work.

A **retrospective** is similar to an [[After action review]] as a safe space to check in on how everything is working. Can use start, stop, continue like we do in performance reviews.
