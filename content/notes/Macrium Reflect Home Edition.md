[Macrium Reflect Home Edition](https://www.macrium.com/products/home)

My daily disk image software. Have been using it for many years. One of the advantages is the ability to restore to a smaller drive.
## Restore
1. Boot from USB rescue disk (use WinPE image as WinRE won't load)
2. Load from Image, click network icon
3. Map to network drive location - needs username and password from [[1Password]].
4. Restore happily
