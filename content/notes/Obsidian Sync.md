I use the official [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) service to securely share my vault between my Macbook, the home PC and my iPhone. It is is a paid sync service from the developers of [[Obsidian]]. It is the most reliable sync solution I've found. I tried [[iCloud as an alternative to Obsidian Sync]] and found it more problematic than the monthly fee it saved.
