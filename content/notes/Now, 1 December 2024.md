I am disappointed with my writing. My vocabulary is grander than I am capable of putting on the page. Ideas and explanations feel undercooked and frequently I began a discourse that peters off to a void of conclusion. I think there are a couple of contributing factors.

1. The quantity of writing is too little, too infrequent. 
2. I am struggling to comprehend what I'm trying to achieve.

The first point should be easily overcome by doing more. I am forcing myself to type and have the thought discipline and habit are probably the only way out. I'm not short of ideas.

The second point is proving difficult to answer. Ironically additional writing, in the form of [[Journaling]] and [[Proprioceptive writing]], will guide me to the answers I'm after. My scope of consideration is larger extends beyond my calibre of writing. The  Christmas break will be a time of renewal and planning across personal growth and work needs. In prior years I have blundered along and needed most of my time away from work to recover. Now I feel resourced. Three day weekends help in ways I have yet to fully grasp.

Speaking of taking Fridays off; I only have 12 days remaining in the office between now and Christmas. The last day will be quiet due to careful planning of commitments between now and then so let's call it 11 days. I'll be busy finishing out some client projects and anything new will be pushed to 2025. 

Today I started [[The Path of Daggers]] as my current novel after eventually finishing [[The Dark Zone]]. Reading about a psycho presidential candidate during the time of the U.S. election was proving stressful and I put it aside.

[[The Legend of Vox Machina]] was on rotation while at Cybercon[^1] and I have just two episodes of season 3 remaining. Next I'll finish off [[Silo]]. Concentrating on a full hour is a proving a struggle.
