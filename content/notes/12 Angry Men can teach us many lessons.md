The 1957 American drama film, [[12 Angry Men]] is above all things a study of character. The story, which takes place almost exclusively in a single room is based on a play by [Reginald Rose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Reginald_Rose) and leads the viewer on a journey into the human condition.

Amongst the required [protagonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protaganist) and [antagonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist) archetypes all is not as it seems and the drift between one and the other shows us the impact of cultural narrative, assessments, assertions, declarations, selfishness, humility and the result of treating them lightly. More so, when they remain hidden to an individual.

I recall first seeing this moving during English class at high school and it is one of the few movies that has made a profound and lasting impact upon me. Though I now know the story well I am riveted to my seat each time I see it. It would be wrong of me to spoil the plot by revealing the storyline so I limit myself to recommending [[12 Angry Men]] as a must see. There is a [1997 remake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1997_film)) which I don't enjoy as much as the original but will still get the lessons across if that's all you can find.
