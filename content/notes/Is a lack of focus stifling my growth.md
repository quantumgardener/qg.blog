  - Is a lack of focus stifling my growth?
---
Last night, I watched [[Henderson (2024), Why we can't focus|Why we can't focus]] and heard [[Jared Henderson]] explain the impact of society's shortening capacity to focus. We have collectively colluded to shift our [[Way of Being]] to something less powerful. Ironically, I was unknowingly searching for that last dopamine hit before going to bed when Jared's video popped up on the screen.

Twice during the video I found my attention wandering. I can easily push that onto tiredness (it was nearing 11pm) but maybe it wasn't. Is my ability to focus shorter than I realised? (Have I even ever considered it?)

I know I am capable of long periods of focus. I read for extended periods of time and yesterday afternoon I spent several hours automating the connection of watch states between [[Plex]] and [[Jellyfin]] media servers[^1].

On reflection, even "in focus" my behaviour is constant mini-departure from the task at hand. I allow myself to get dragged away without thinking of it. In the interest of providing relevant information and links, I went sideways into a footnote. A written example of [[Do you over-aside|Do you over -aside?]] which itself is a symptom of lack of focus.

My phone remains on the bedside table charger. I reached for it in my pocket 6 times before finishing breakfast.

Truth be told, I'm a [[Anxiety|little scared]] for what this means. Although at the same time imbued with a sense of [[Wonder]] and [[Optimism]]. [[With knowledge comes power to change]] and I have a new [[Distinction]] to work with. 

In July I moved to a 4-day week. Part of my plan was to spend time on the activities that make my heart sing. I have progressed; my writing continues to improve and I have built tools that assist[^2]. Despite this I have never been able to delve deeply into the detail of what the future beyond better prose and techniques looks like. It has remained elusive. The mental feeling I have is like water sliding around a rock. As I approach my thoughts move sideways and I can't grab hold. Maybe it isn't the rock pushing the water of thought aside but something pulling it away from the rock instead.
