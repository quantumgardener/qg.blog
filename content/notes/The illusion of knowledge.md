The [Checker Shadow optical illusion](http://www-bcs.mit.edu/people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html) is a great way to visualise one of the most common problems facing the sharing of knowledge. That is, depending on where we 'stand' we see different thingsâ€”even if they are the same.

*Squares A and B are the same colour grey*

> *I've scrutinized this optical illusion. I verified the hexadecimal values of the colors with Adobe Photoshop. I even cut both squares out of the original image and pasted them next to each other. And still I can't make my brain believe it. Very impressive. I need to read the explanation again...*(from [curious frog](http://www.curiousfrog.com/weblog/archives/000105.html#000105))

And just to be sure, I did it as well.
