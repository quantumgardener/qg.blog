An *After action review* is a [[Conversation for clarity]] used to quickly debrief a situation and engage in [[First-order learning]] and [[Second-order learning]] prior to facing a similar situation again.

The 4 questions should be answered in sequence.

1. What was supposed to happen?
2. What actually happened?
3. Why were there differences?
4. What can we do next time differently?

Since an after action review is designed to be carried out quickly in the field[^1] the time for deep fact-finding can be limited. Question 1-3, are at risk of [[Ungrounded assessment]] over [[True assertion]].

Questions 3 and 4 are where learning occurs but it is more important to address the [[Second-order learning]] whys as the [[First-order learning]] whys, as described in [[Strengthening After Action Reviews through Double-loop learning]].
