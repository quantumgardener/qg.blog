title: The mood of resentment
---
Closely related to [[Anger]], [[Resentment]] is the older cousin triggered as a mood whenever we don't like what we see. Our internal conversation says, "This is wrong. It should be otherwise", and often, "They are to blame for this." In this mood we strike out to punish hoping that is the solution. When that fails to resolve the problem [[Resignation]] can quickly follow. The stronger path forward is to accept that which we cannot change and adopt Peace/Acceptance as a platform to move forward.
