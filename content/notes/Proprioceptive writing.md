A ritual 25-minute self-guided exercise where writing and listening is used to reflect on the [[Stories]] underpinning our [[Way of Being]]. The output is called a "write".

[[Metcalf, Simon (2002), Writing the Mind Alive]] introduces and contextualises the practice.
## Preparation
- Sit somewhere safe and quiet
- Light a candle
- Play some quiet Baroque music (the largos, adagios, adantes)
- Use unlined paper (I play to type)
## 3 rules in creating a "Write"
1. Write what you hear
2. Listen to what you write - engage in a conversation
3. Be ready to ask the Proprioceptive Question - "What do I mean by?"
## Concluding questions
1. What thoughts were heard but not written?
2. How or what do I feel now?
3. What larger story is the write part of?
4. What ideas came up for future writes?
