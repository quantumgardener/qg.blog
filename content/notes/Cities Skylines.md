![[vg_cities_skylines.webp|200]]

I got into [[Cities Skylines]] during COVID and i played a lot of it. Something like 200 hours which puts it second behind [[Elite - Dangerous]] for overall game time. There is something I find compelling in layout out roads, zoning areas of development and then fixing all the problems I created.
