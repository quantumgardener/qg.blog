[[Marcus Aurelius]] constantly reminds use that death is the only thing we can be sure of. It is a logical view that although we live our lives otherwise, who we are will eventually be forgotten within a few generations[^1].

"You can't take it with you", is a common refrain made about the wealth collected during one's lifetime. It applies to the story we have of ourself as well.
