On Monday night I had the privilege of meeting some students from the [local university](http://www.bendigo.latrobe.edu.au). I had offered to make myself available as a business mentor ready to be questioned on all topics. So why was I privileged? Surely one could say they had the privilege of listening to me for an hour and a half?

Thirteen students gave up their evening — on trust — to listen to whatever advice I had to offer; if I had any at all. None had met me before, nor did they know who I was or what my background was.

The conversation centred on how they could get a job at the end of their course. The majority were first year students and some second. All but one was doing a three year course. I told what stories I could and in the process learnt that the quality of the stories we tell has a great effect impact on the understanding of others. When I was relating an example with passion they were listening. When I wasn't so sure and worked to make something fit the question, it was obvious to all and I could see the listening wasn't as high. People started squirming in their seats and looking away.

There is a lot for the fourteen people who were in a small room on Monday night to learn about themselves and each other.
