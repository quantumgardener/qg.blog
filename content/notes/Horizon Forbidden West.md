This is the sequel to [[Horizon Zero Dawn]].

I really enjoyed this game. The developers have polished out the gameplay elements that were cumbersome from the first and it's much better for it. The game is simply stunning to look at and the motion-capture for Aloy's interactions with others as good as I've ever seen.

## Main story
The main story was engaging and the game a challenge throughout. Towards the end I very much had to to think and be skilful to keep up. 

I completed the main story line, including all my side-adventures, in 76 hours.

## Platinum Trophy
I was on track to complete the [[Platinum trophy]] not long after the main story line. The trophy for killing all Acquisition machines would not drop. I went through the list 3 times, killed one of every type of machine at least once, and it still wouldn't trigger.

I put it down to a bug. With each patch I tried again to no avail. Eventually it turned out I was misreading a key component of the list. 

Another 5 hours and I properly completed the my 10th platinum

## Burning Shores DLC

I completed the Burning Shores DLC on [[2023-11-26]] after starting it the day before. A great storyline that could easily have been part of the main story it was so well integrated. Starting at level 50 Aloy was simply over-powered and that made it adventurous fun. No complaints at all.
