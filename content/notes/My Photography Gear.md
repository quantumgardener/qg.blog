> [!INFO] This is my current photography gear. I have also recorded [[My Camera History]].

## Camera
I have a [[Canon R50 Mirrorless]] backed up by a [Canon 400D DSLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_400D) .

## Tripods
I have two tripods. The Benro Slim Aluminium Video Tripod with S2 Head was purchased in 2021 for my [[Celestron SkyMaster 20x80 Binoculars]] but fell short in height. I have a Neewer Professional Tripod that gives me the height I need so I've swapped the S2 video head to that and use the Benro as my camera tripod.

## Accessories
- [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/capture)
- [Peak Design Anchor Links Strap Connectors](https://au.peakdesign.com/products/anchor-links) for camera strap flexibility.
- [Lowepro ProTactic BP 350 AW II camera bag](https://www.lowepro.com/au-en/protactic-bp-350-aw-ii-lp37176-grl/) with a [Tenba Tools Tool Box 8](https://tenba.com/tenba-tools-tool-box-8-black/) for the [[Canon R50 Mirrorless|Canon R50]] that allows me to travel lighter if needed.
- [Neewer Timer Remote](https://neewer.com/collections/trigger-remote-control/products/neewer-timer-remote-for-canon-50d-66600644), primarily for [[Astrophotography]] on the [[Canon 400D DSLR|Canon 400D]].
- [Canon Mount Adapter EF-EOS R](https://www.canon.com.au/accessories-supplies/mount-adapter-ef-eos-r)

## Wishlist

### Circular Polariser and Neutral Density Filters
From what I've seen [Kase Filters](https://www.kaseaustralia.com.au) are the way to go. 67mm kit will work with my current and planned future lenses. Don't know how it steps up for other lenses with the Revolution series without needing to get the 82mm set. I need calculations to see if it's worth it.
