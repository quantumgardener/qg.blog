> [!INFO] This is my current photography gear. I have also recorded [[My Camera History]].

## Camera
I have a [[Canon R50 Mirrorless]] backed up by a [Canon 400D DSLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_400D) t

## Tripods
I have two tripods. The Benro Slim Aluminium Video Tripod with S2 Head was purchased in 2021 for my [[Celestron SkyMaster 20x80 Binoculars]] but fell short in height. I have a Neewer Professional Tripod that gives me the height I need so I've swapped the S2 video head to that and use the Benro as my camera tripod.

## Accessories
- [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/capture)
- [Lowepro ProTactic BP 350 AW II camera bag](https://www.lowepro.com/au-en/protactic-bp-350-aw-ii-lp37176-grl/)
- [Neewer Timer Remote](https://neewer.com/collections/trigger-remote-control/products/neewer-timer-remote-for-canon-50d-66600644), primarily for [[Astrophotography]]

## Wishlist
### Replacement Camera Body and Lenses
I'm actively looking to replace my 400D DSLR with a Canon R50 Mirrorless paired with a 18-45mm and 55-210mm lens. I'll probably add an EF/S to EF-R mount and use the Canon EF-S 17-85 lens in place of the 18-45. It is a better lens than the smaller kit lens.

The R50 provides:
- Live view on the back screen
- More focusing points
- +/- 3 stops of exposure bracketing instead of +/- 2
- ISO greater than 1600
- Lighter body
- 4K video recording
- More pixels of the mega kind
- Interface and technology that is 17 years further forward
- Hi-res viewfinder
- Lighter weight body

### Circular Polariser and Neutral Density Filters
From what I've seen [Kase Filters](https://www.kaseaustralia.com.au) are the way to go. 67mm kit will work with my current and planned future lenses. Don't know how it steps up for other lenses with the Revolution series without needing to get the 82mm set. I need calculations to see if it's worth it.
