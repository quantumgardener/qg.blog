> [!INFO] This is my current [[Photography]] gear. I have also recorded [[My Camera History]].

## Camera
I have a [[Canon R50 Mirrorless]] backed up by a [Canon 400D DSLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_400D) .

## Tripods
I have two tripods. The Benro Slim Aluminium Video Tripod with S2 Head was purchased in 2021 for my [[Celestron SkyMaster 20x80 Binoculars]] but fell short in height. I have a Neewer Professional Tripod that gives me the height I need so I've swapped the S2 video head to that and use the Benro as my camera tripod.

## Accessories
- [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/capture)
- [Peak Design Cuff Camera Wrist Strap | Peak Design Official Site](https://au.peakdesign.com/products/cuff)
- [Peak Design Anchor Links Strap Connectors](https://au.peakdesign.com/products/anchor-links) for camera strap flexibility.
- [Lowepro ProTactic BP 350 AW II camera bag](https://www.lowepro.com/au-en/protactic-bp-350-aw-ii-lp37176-grl/) with a [Tenba Tools Tool Box 8](https://tenba.com/tenba-tools-tool-box-8-black/) for the [[Canon R50 Mirrorless|Canon R50]] that allows me to travel lighter if needed. I am looking to replace the Tenba with a [Peak Design 3L Sling](https://au.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-sling/?variant=31374288027725).
- [Neewer Timer Remote](https://neewer.com/collections/trigger-remote-control/products/neewer-timer-remote-for-canon-50d-66600644), primarily for [[Astrophotography]] on the [[Canon 400D DSLR|Canon 400D]].

## Wishlist

### Circular Polariser and Neutral Density Filters
K&E filters seem to be a good compromise between starting out and spending more money than I should. 
- [67mm Magnetic CPL Filter Kit - Magnetic CPL+ Apater ring + Cap | K&F Concept AU - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/SKU.1705_67mm-nano-x-cpl-magnetic-filter-high-definition-coated-with-waterproof-scratch-resistant-and-anti-reflection-green-film-with-magnetic-attachment-ring-and-magnetic-metal-cover) $103
- I have both a 49-67mm and a 55-67mm step up ring. This covers 2/3 of the smaller than 67mm lenses so I need another step up ring. [New 2023 Brass Filter Adapter Ring Step-Up Ring - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/search_step%20up%20lens%20filter/KF05.313_49-67mm-brass-filter-adapter-ring-step-up-ring-compatible-wi) $30
- Then, get 3 more magnetic adaptors and lens caps
	- [67mm Empty Magnetic Base Ring | K&F Concept AU - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/KF05.288_67mm-empty-magnetic-base-ring-works-only-with-kf-magnetic-quick-swap-system) 3 x $30 = $90
	- [67mm Magnetic Metal Lens Caps 2-in-1 (Works only with K&F Concept Magnetic Filters) - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/KF04.071_67mm-magnetic-metal-lens-caps-works-only-with-kf-concept-magnetic-filters) 3 x $24 = $72

That adds up to quite a bit at $295. Alternatively, I could not worry about stepping up and purchase for the lenses I have.
- [49mm Magnetic CPL Filter Kit - Magnetic CPL+ Apater ring + Cap | K&F Concept AU - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/SKU.1700_49mm-nano-x-cpl-magnetic-filter-high-definition-coated-with-waterproof-scratch-resistant-anti-reflection-green-film-with-magnetic-attachment-ring-and-magnetic-metal-cover) $101
- [55mm Magnetic CPL Filter Kit - Magnetic CPL+ Apater ring + Cap | K&F Concept AU - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/SKU.1702_55mm-nano-x-cpl-magnetic-filter-high-definition-coated-with-waterproof-scratch-resistant-anti-reflection-green-film-with-magnetic-attachment-ring-and-magnetic-metal-cover) $91
- [49mm Empty Magnetic Base Ring | K&F Concept AU - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/KF05.283_49mm-empty-magnetic-base-ring-works-only-with-kf-magnetic-quick-swap-system) $30
- [49mm Magnetic Metal Lens Caps 2-in-1 (Works only with K&F Concept Magnetic Filters) - K&F Concept](https://www.kentfaith.com.au/KF04.066_49mm-magnetic-metal-lens-caps-works-only-with-kf-concept-magnetic-filters) $25
Totals $246 and all I miss out on is the 67mm magnetic cap, but I also have the benefit of not needing step up rings.
