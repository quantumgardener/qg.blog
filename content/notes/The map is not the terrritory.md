This concept is an attempt to get people to remember there is more than just the map. Yet, maps show relationships. In the case of a road map, it's the relationships between A and B and importantly how to get there. 

[[Map of content|Maps of content]], [[Concept mapping]] and [[Mind mapping|Mind maps]] are all examples of mapping in the [[Knowledge management]] and [[Personal knowledge management|PKM]] spaces where they provide an abstraction level across the territory of knowledge. 

Maps are important. Expanding the area of my map—removing fog— will help in [[Expanding my comfort zone]].
