A *digital garden* is a form of website where the author creates and curates ideas in public. 

As they collect information and write, notes are published in various stages of completeness (tagged [[Seedling]], [[Budding]] or [[Evergreen]]) so that others can benefit from what's there and then, without the burden of having to finish an article. In other words, [[A digital garden's content is always growing]].

This allows the author to continue writing and tending to other areas of the garden, perhaps before they have finished with the first garden bed.

You're in a digital garden right now.
