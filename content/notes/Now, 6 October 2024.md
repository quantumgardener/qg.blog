With a full belly of Sunday roast I've just come back from a short walk. The temperature was nice enough for t-shirt and jeans and even though the Sun had dropped, there was still some light remaining in the West. 

I needed some time on my own. With my daughter back for the weekend and a few days, and visits to-and-fro, I am peopled out. It happens now and then, but today felt particularly acute.

There are a couple of articles to come. One on how I completely screwed up my home network rebuild and then another on how I recovered magnificently. I'd hoped to get the first done today but nah, too much going on around me. It has been a few weeks of learning and mulling over which approach to take and I'm tired. Outside of the next piece of learning I need on how to structure firewall rules well, it's done and working as I want.

I visited the early part of the third century BC today. Marcus Aurelius and I are spending some time with his *Meditations*. Often I'm led to feel guilty about not writing daily. Here I see valuable writing in small, focused and deliberate pieces across many years. My own journalling follows a similar pattern of time. The worse I feel in life, the more compelled I am to write.
