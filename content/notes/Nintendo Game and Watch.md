Unless you were there it's hard to imagine the hype that came with these simple handheld games. Each was an LCD screen with fixed images, surrounded by buttons and a shiny screen. Some were even foldable with two screens.

*Today's controllers still have the d-pad on the left and action buttons on the right.*

Clearly precursors to the [[Nintendo Gameboy]] and even controllers for [[PlayStation 1]] and beyond (minus the screen of course).
