[1Password](https://1password.com/)) is a password manager that securely stores passwords and other credentials, shareable across platforms and protected by a master password.

I have a family plan for sharing home passwords with my family members.

The process of creating secure, memorable passphrases as described in [[Secure passwords at the roll of a dice]] can be done within [[1Password]] and generating a "memorable password" instead of a "random password".
