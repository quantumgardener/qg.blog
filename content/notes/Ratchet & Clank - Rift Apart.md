This is a sequel to [[Ratchet & Clank]] which I thoroughly enjoyed playing. I started this on 15 June 2021. It's the first dedicated [[PlayStation 5]] title that I have been looking forward to with all the bells and whistles.

So much fun and so fast. It took a while for me to get used to the motion at high speed and not feel dizzy afterwards.
