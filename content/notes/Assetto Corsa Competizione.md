Assetto Corsa  Competizione, or race trim competition, is a racing simulator. 

I've been playing it since just before Christmas 2021 and find it more challenging and enjoyable than the sim'cade that is [[Gran Turismo Sport]]. 

I race on the [[PlayStation 5|PS5]], with a [[Thrustmaster T300 RS GT]], mounted on an [[APEX Steering Wheel Stand]].

My car of choice is the BMW M4.

Because I play in the lounge room, I'm sat 2.5m from the screen. This means I need to seriously consider adjusting the Field-of-View to better match my natural vision. It calculates at 16deg, and I've upped that a little to wdea so that I can see the corner apexes. Amazing the "correct" FOV makes the racing feel slower. I am better able to pick braking points and apexes. When racing side-by-side, I can get closer to the cars around me and make better judgement.
