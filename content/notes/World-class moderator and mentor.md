Mentors play such an important part in our lives. Today I was blessed to hear that someone who I've been working alongside for several years now has been describing me to her friends as her mentor. I trust it is no coincidence I just heard from one of my mentors — [Roy Sheppard, World Class Moderator](https://roysheppard.co.uk) — the very person who showed me there was such a thing as personal development and to whom I ultimately owe the identification of my calling to guide people to the path of self improvement and walk beside them on their journey.

Roy has just launched the [World Class Moderator](https://roysheppard.co.uk) site to showcase his speaking work. Take a moment to have a look. You never know what may come from it.
