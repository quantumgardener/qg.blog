![[tv_The Watch.webp]]

A dramatisation of [[Discworld]]'s Night Watch. It took me a long time to get through this series and I would tackle only a couple of episodes at a time. It's nice to be in [[Terry Pratchett|Terry Pratchett's]] world even if it's not a 1:1 match to the books. Vimes was my favourite character.
