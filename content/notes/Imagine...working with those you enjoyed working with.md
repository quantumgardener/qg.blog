Last night I attended an alumni function for ex-employees of [[Arthur Andersen]]. It was a great feeling to again be in a room with people that I respect greatly and have enjoyed working with. A couple of which I hadn't seen for six or more years. I got to thinking ...what if you could create an opportunity for all of the people you enjoy working with to work together again.

- Imagine the sense of goodwill that would envelop the workplace.
- Imagine the opportunities that would be created.
- Imagine the politics you wouldn't have to put up with.
- Imagine waking in the morning and looking forward to "work" and meeting again the people whose company you truly enjoy.
