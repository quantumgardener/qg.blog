Following the recent demise of [[Omnivore]], I self-hosted [[Wallabag]] on my [[Synology DiskStation DS920+]]. However, conscious of the risk of a cyber attacker potentially moving laterally across my [[Docker]] containers, I've moved my read-later article capture to the [official hosted site](https://app.wallabag.it).

I'm not suggesting there are any issues with self-hosted [[Wallabag]]. That's not the case at all. Cyber security is a balance and often a compromise and I'm operating from general principles and a balance of probabilities. I did have [[Cloudflare]] MFA in front of the self-hosted site which prevented me from connecting via the app or [[Firefox]] widget.
