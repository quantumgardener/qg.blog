# Synopsis
In *A Plague Tale: Innocence* you play Amicia, a teenage girl who goes on a journey to save her little brother Hugo from an unknown affliction and the power hungry Church. It's a supernatural story set against the background of 14th Century France.

# Review
When a game's name keeps popping up over time, that is usually a sign it's worth playing and I'm very glad I listened to that advice. Innocence is a charming tale of two estranged siblings that come to care for each other deeply over the course of the adventure.

Gameplay is straightforward and often telegraphed which makes Innocence a good candidate for first time RPG players, despite the dark nature of the story (hint: it's in the title). There were only a couple of challenges right at the end where the difficulty spiked and I wondered if I were playing [[Elden Ring]] again. 

Most of the gameplay is stealth centered and there is little in the way of combat as you might experience in your typical RPG. Alicia's primary weapon is a sling or thrown alchemical pots.

Beyond the few sections where I made a wrong decision, or temporarily lost my ability to work the controller properly with my butter fingers and had to replay a short section, there was only a single repeated line of dialog. That shows you how much of the game is story based.

I give *A Plague Tale: Innocence* 4/5 stars and will be playing the sequel, [[A Plague Tale - Requiem|A Plague Tale: Requiem]] in the future. It is a rare game that has me so invested in the story.
