Many of the old blog posts I'm currently converting and republishing as of their original dates are not making the cut. I'm finding it difficult to know what is quoted writing and what is my own commentary on that writing. Though I have a good sense of my tone to distinguish my words from those of others, I want to be accurate out of respect for the original author. Where I can't be sure at all, I'm committing the post to the wasteland. Unfortunately most of the links I've referenced are all broken so I can't check.
