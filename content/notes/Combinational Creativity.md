[[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]] came to the field through discovering the [[Generation Effect]].

Creativity does not come from a muse. It all comes from combining pre-existing ideas. That's important because it means you can make a process out of being creative. It can be driven, rather than waiting for inspiration.

I've felt my creativity in the past has been stifled because it felt like I was creating something another had already created. [[Combinational Creativity]] give me the permission to create anyway. It won't be quite the same. My experiences are different from theirs.

[[Software Development]] is a [[Combinational Creativity]] creativity. It's similar because the developer is bringing existing models and ways of doing things to a new problem. I've always thought of software development as being highly creative, akin to an artform. There is such a thing as highly artistic [[Elegant Code]].

Techniques to support [[Combinational Creativity]]:
1. How does A impact B? eg. How does the [[Generation Effect]] impact [[Distinction|Distinctions]]?
2. Clustering. What does A and B have in common? Strengthens each idea. 
3. Compare and contrast. How is A similar and different from B (and vice-versa)?

These are similar to the questions put forward in [[The NoMa Method]]. Linking them can be done through [[Maps of Content]] or [[Concept Mapping]]. Although [[The Map is Not the Terrritory]] it is an important guide to my knowledge. [[Backlinks are Important]] in a text tool for identifying previously unseen relationships.
