[[Tad Williams]]’ Otherland quadrilogy is a sweeping, considerate romp though more virtual worlds than I can count. It’s been maybe 15 years since I last read the series and it reads quite current. The sense of reality in the virtual reality is more real now as technologies and cultures have moved on.

All four books resonate too close to home in today's turbulent world. The epigraph at the beginning of every chapter could be taken from today's news.

I first read *City of Golden Shadow* when I lived in [[London]] and the full series some years later. I finished the series again via audiobook on [[2025-01-08|8 January 2025]].
