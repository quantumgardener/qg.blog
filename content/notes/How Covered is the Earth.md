When I find myself waiting in the car to pick someone up, I often play a mental game of working out how high the Earth would be covered if everything humankind has made were flattened and spread out. In a sense, melted.

My estimate is less than 10cm covering the land and I would not be surprised if it was way less. What do you think?
