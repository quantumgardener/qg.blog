title: Is Knowledge Manager a recognised occupation?
---
Take a trip to your nearest internet job site (such as [Seek](http://www.seek.com.au) or [Monster](http://www.monster.com.au) in Australia) and search for "knowledge manager". My guess is that you won't find much. In fact, you won't even find knowledge manager in the drop down list of standard 'roles'.
What does this tell us?

Firstly I believe it suggests that *knowledge manager* as a position is not recognised by the market. That's not surprising as many businesses don't yet know what [[Knowledge management]] is. Chief Knowledge Officer (CKO) positions are a standout example of clear employment roles but they are as yet few and far between.

Secondly it reflects that *knowledge manager* is a mindset or way of operating that is applicable to many positions rather than the position itself. It is a skill.
