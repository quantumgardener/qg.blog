A large [[Zettelkasten]] will have notes and above that notes which describe the structure in which the lower level notes are connected. These are the same as a table of contents for content and order. With enough structure notes, another level of structure note is needed[^1]. 

A [[Map of content]] may be less structured than a table of contents, but it still provides structure.
