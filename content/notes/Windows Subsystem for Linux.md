Reaching the limit of how I can engage with some systems on [[Github]], [dSebastien@pkmsocial](https://pkm.social/@dsebastien) recommended I try WSL to work on their [obsidian-dataview-serializer plugin](https://github.com/dsebastien/obsidian-dataview-serializer) for [[Obsidian]]. There were a couple of tweaks I though I could make, but was unable to get the build running in native Windows.
