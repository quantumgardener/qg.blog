An organisation is a collection of people, each with their own [[Way of Being]]. Applying the same idea to an organisation as a person, [[The three ontological domains]] have equivalency in an organisation.

| Person                     | Organisation          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [[The domain of language]] | Systems and processes |
| [[The domain of emotion]]  | Culture               |
| [[The domain of body]]     | People                |
