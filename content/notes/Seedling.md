*Seedling* is a [[Digital garden]] concept, used to mark articles that are published publicly for the purpose of sharing learning online, and where the author knows the article is in an early form. After receiving some care, seedlings should transition to [[Budding]] status and eventually become [[Evergreen]], but we know from experience that not all seedlings survive.

See [[The value of growth maturity in a digital garden is marginal]] for a discussion of why notes are not marked [[Seedling]] in this [[Digital garden]].
