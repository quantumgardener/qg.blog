Do you have business cards in a nice holder on your desk? Where else?
I've just taken delivery of 1,000 new business cards. Here is where have mine and where I think you should have yours. After all, what is the cost of missing business or a new relationship because there is no card to hand.

- In the business card holder on your desk (that's the obvious one).
- In your business card dispenser — carry it with you alongside your purse/wallet. Holds more cards and in perfect condition.
- In your purse/wallet — check these regularly and replace any that are tatty.
- In you car's glovebox — for when you get to a networking event and run out of cards.
- In your laptop bag — you never know who else you'll met when at a client's doing work.
- In your business card holder (the one with pockets for cards) — because you always have it with you so that you can hand out cards of people you know when making referrals (You don't? Perhaps you should think about doing so).\
- In your folio that you use to take notes.
- In your iPhone/iPad protective cover if it has a place for cards.
- In the back of any name tag holders you wear at regular events.
- In your jacket pockets — as long as you remember to take them out
- before dry cleaning.

You may be thinking I've only got 250 cards as that's all that comes in a box. Order more. The fewer you have the lower the chance you'll hand them out. In the back of your mind is "I've only got a few. I have to make them count. Perhaps I don't hand this one out." Print economies of scale mean 1,000 costs less than 2 x 250.

It took me 5 minutes to distribute my cards as I've described above. 200/1,000 now stored within easy reach. There may be more places. Think outside the (business card delivery) box.
