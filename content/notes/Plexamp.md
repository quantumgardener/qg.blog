[[Plexamp]] is a music playing application that serves audio from a [[Plex]] server. ~~It can integrate music from Tidal with a subscription.[^1]~~

An advantage of [[Plexamp]] is its ability to provide audio in the original quality and to transcode it to lower bitrates if necessary. 

[[Plexamp setup is easy]] and music is available everywhere because [[Plex streams securely outside the home]].

[[Plexamp]] works with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Apple Watch]] as well as many other devices.
