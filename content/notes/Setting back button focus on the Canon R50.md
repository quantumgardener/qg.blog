title: Back button focus on the Canon R50
---
The shutter-release button on a camera serves two functions out of the boxâ€” Focus/exposure lock, and taking the picture. The internet abounds with recommendations to split these functions and use back-button focussing[^1] instead. New higher-end cameras come with a button specific to that purpose. The [[Canon R50 Mirrorless|Canon R50]] does not and requires a bit of button assignment dexterity to achieve the same effect. Refer to the [camera manual](https://cam.start.canon/en/C011/manual/html/UG-10_Custom_0030.html) for guidance on reassigning buttons.

1. Set `Shutter butt. half-press` to `Metering start`. This disables auto-focus on the button.
2. Set `AE Lock Button [*]` to `Metering and AF start` . This enables `[*]`  as the back AF button. It's really the only choice available without taking other functions away.
3. Select `AF Operation` to `Servo` (Menu AF/1). This allows you to hold the `[*]` button while moving the camera and it will lock focus when released.
4. Disable `Preview AF` (Menu AF/2)[^2] to prevent the viewfinder/screen from updating focus if moved. "This function keeps subjects generally in focus. The camera is ready to focus immediately when you press the shutter button halfway."[^3]
