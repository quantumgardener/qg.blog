Was astounded by the opening to the game. How self-indulgent of the developers. For a racing sim, with a heavy focus on car culture and collecting, why force everyone to play a round of the new music mode before 10 minutes of credits. Really? Drive around to music, needing to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out.

Once I did get past all that, I was able to use the [[Thrustmaster T300 RS GT]] and do some proper driving. I have my B license. One of my work colleagues is playing as well so I could see -- and beat -- his times.

- Finished the campaign mode. Really enjoyed it. Can't wait for [[PlayStation VR2]] racing to commence.
