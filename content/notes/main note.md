A [[main note]] is a central [[concept]] or [[idea]] in a [[zettelkasten]] system. It is formed by the thoughtful conjunction of multiple notes (including other main notes) into something new.

Linking to existing notes, along with avoidance of duplication, comes from going slowly and recalling [[main note|main notes]] that may already exist[^1]. This practice is very similar to [[The 2-Minute Rule]] employed in [[Getting Things Done]].

Every [[main note]] is a [[permanent note]].
