Books purchased through Amazon are protected against copying and distribution by a level of digital rights management that can no longer be bypassed.

This prevents people who have purchased a digital book from reading it on non-Amazon devices.

It's equivalent to Amazon selling you a physical book that can only be read by the glasses they provide.

Until now I've been able to successfully remove DRM from Amazon books using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and [DeDRM_tools](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools) but have reached the end of that line. Going forward I'll be purchasing books from [[Kobo Books]] and [[Google Play]].
