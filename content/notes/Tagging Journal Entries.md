These are the tags I apply to [[31 Journal|Journal entries]]. They are a means of quickly bringing related entries together so that I can see themes. Journals can have more than one tag.

> [!TIP] I'm slowly working through all past entries checking they are correctly tagged and doing things like adding a photo when I know there is one of relevance.
