The term [[Way of Being]] could be taking as equivalent to "Way of doing in the world" but this is not the case. Our Way of Being refers to how we perceive the world in the moment[^1]. 

The meaning we make of events, conversations, circumstances, people and objects, changes as our Way of Being changes. That interpretation is how we choose our resultant behaviours.
