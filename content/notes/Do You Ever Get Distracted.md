Me, earlier this evening…

1. “I’ll go to the supermarket and get bread while you’re out”
2. Ah, my Amazon order of _[[Forspoken]]_ hasn’t arrived yet. I want to be home when it comes. I’ll play _[[Spaces/Media/Video Games/Stray]]_ instead while I wait. Start up Playstation.
3. Alarm goes off. It’s bin night.
4. Take bins out.
5. Green waste bin almost empty. What can I fill it with. “Ah ha!”. Cut down a dozen branches hanging over the road and driveway.

Five distractions in 20 minutes.

Yes, I did eventually get bread. Amazon haven’t turned up yet.
