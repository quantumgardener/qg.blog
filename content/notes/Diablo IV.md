After playing [[Diablo III - Reaper of Souls - Ultimate Evil Edition|Diablo III]] all the way to level 50 a couple of times, I was expecting more from this game. However, after slogging through the same scenario time and time again, it got to a section with a battle where the difficulty ramped up too quickly for me to be bothered with. No sense pushing through just to get to more of the same.
