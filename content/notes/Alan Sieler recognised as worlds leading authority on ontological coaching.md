[Alan Sieler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-sieler-ab102711/), my coaching mentor and trainer, has been recognised by publishers Sage as the world's leading authority on [[Ontological coaching]] as reported in the [November 2009 Newfield Institute newsletter](http://www2.newfieldinstitute.com.au/ 112009.html).

> In the midst of a very busy work and travel schedule, I am pleased to report that Alan Sieler continues to find time to write! Alan is making steady progress on Volume III of [Coaching to the Human Soul](https://www.ontologicalcoaching.com.au/books), which is on track for publication in two years time. Alan was recently recognised by the prestigious academic publishers Sage as the world's leading authority on Ontological Coaching and has been commissioned to contribute a chapter on Ontological Coaching for *The Complete Handbook of Coaching*. Keep an eye out for this publication in 2010.

To learn more about the valuable approach that is [[Ontological coaching]], I suggest you read Alan's paper, [Ontology as a Theoretical Basis for Professional Coaching](https://www.ontologicalcoaching.com.au/post/ontology-as-a-theoretical-basis-for-professional-coaching)
