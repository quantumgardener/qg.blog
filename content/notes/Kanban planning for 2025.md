I've never found a use for Kanban boards before now. With holidays upon me I must map what I want to achieve including 2025 and beyond. Early last week I was reminded of [[MoSCoW]], a little mnemonic to help order around Must, Should, Could and Won't. A colleague and I used it successfully to order the security initiatives in a report we'd written, and I made the cognitive jump to my own situation.

I'm gathering ideas into two lists, each organised using [[MoSCoW]]. The [Obsidian Kanban Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/kanban/Obsidian+Kanban+Plugin) is useful to organise and rearrange items. In front of the [[MoSCoW]] columns is one called `Ideas` for quick [[Getting Things Done|GTD-like]] inbox capture before processing.

Despite the weight of planning, I am less stressed with this approach than past experience suggests I would have been otherwise.
