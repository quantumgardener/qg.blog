If you loved [[Gladiator]] you will like [[Gladiator II]]. If you liked [[Gladiator]], then the sequel will be a good night's popcorn entertainment. If [[Gladiator]] didn't exist, would we be going as made for this next movie as the first? I don't think so.

The sense of drive and revenge from the first movie simply isn't there. The team try to create a sense of loss but all future references are super cliché and never really land home. It feels as if [[Ridley Scott ]]knew he was treading well-worn ground and didn't want to hit the same points as the original. Yet, we get the same fights, in the same order, at the same scale. Overall, lazy.

Don't watch this for the character development of the first movie. There ain't any.

I only watched the trailer for [[Gladiator II]] once. [[Denzel Washington]] seemed completely out of place and it was hard to look past, "WTF is Denzel Washington doing here." Yet, this could be another Oscar winning performance. Not for the character development though (see previous point).

After a tough week I needed the escape. On that point, [[Gladiator II]] delivered.
