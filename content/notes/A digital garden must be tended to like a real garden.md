The activities that occur in a real garden are just as applicable to knowledge and ideas in a [[Digital garden]].

- Ideas and thoughts are cultivated.
- Weeding—removing content which is unnecessary or distracting—keeps the garden tidy and understandable.
- Pruning removes old content that is no longer relevant or outdated.
- Harvesting takes the growth of the digital garden and shares it to the world.
- Grafting brings together the fruits of multiple ideas into new ideas.
