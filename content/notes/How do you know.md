title: How do you know?

My wife and I have just attended a prep grade information session which explained how reading, writing and maths are being taught to our youngest daughter. The teachers suggested we help by pointing out shapes in the home and asking what they are then follow up with, "How do you know?". For a triangle we should be told 3 sides and 3 points and so on.

It struck me how useful it would be to have this question in the workplace. I see too many decisions and actions taken on the basis of what someone believes to be true very often without any substantial basis other than it's what they believe.
People who speak in generalities but can't provide or offer to provide real evidence need to have this question asked of them directly. It will be confronting, even if asked sincerely. Yet it should not be something you have to apologise for. Some people will have the guts to say, "You know what? I don't really know". Then you have a basis to move forward.
