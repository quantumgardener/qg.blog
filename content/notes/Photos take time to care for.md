My [[Mediabank]] import folder has 3,685 photos and videos waiting for me to cull, add metadata and file. It's a big job and hard to keep up with. Across three of us, we generate close to 200 images a month. Maybe a fourth of these are permanently filed.

I have honed the process over many years[^1], and am also looking at earlier photos to remove unnecessary duplicates. Nobody needs 10 shots of the same birthday cake.

With my new [[Canon R50 Mirrorless|Canon R50]] I want to develop my photo editing skills. That too adds time. Below is an image from a trip to [[Kangaroo Island, SA]] earlier this year. It took at least an hour to make the edits I wanted to bring out shadow detail, add more contrast to the sky and remove some unsightly branches top-right. The photo was taken quickly as I pulled off to the side of the road. The main compositional element is the road leading to the lighthouse. I failed to consider the edges of the image or overall balance.
