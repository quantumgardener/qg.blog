description: Overview of how I use Quartz to display this digital garden. Includes a list of customisations I've made.
---
An [[Obsidian]] to website publishing system that allows me to publish directly out of my [[Digital Garden]] and so retain the benefits of a single, frictionless workflow. The GitHub source is at  https://quartz.jzhao.xyz.

[The Quantum Garden](https://quantumgardener.blog) moved to Quartz in September 2023.

## Folder Structure
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["/"] --> B(fa:fa-note-sticky notes)
    A --> C(fa:fa-square-rss blog)
    A --> E(fa:fa-tree maturity)
    A --> F(fa:fa-mountain-sun landscapes)
    A --> D(fa:fa-lock assets)
    A --> G(fa:fa-lock management)
```
- **[notes](/notes/index)** is the folder where most of the garden's content is kept.
- **[blog](/blog/index)** holds transitional notes, relevant only to a point in time.
- [maturity](/maturity/index) is the index of all note maturity levels.
- [landscapes](/landscapes/index) is the index of all landscapes.
- **assets** holds supporting images and attachments and is not publicly accessible.
- **[[Quartz/management/index|Management]]** holds notes I use to support the site and requires [[Obsidian]] as queries are used. It's convenient to have them all together with the other notes.

## Customisations for *The Quantum Garden*
The modifications I've made from [the original codebase](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) are listed below with the file(s) where the change has been made. You're more than welcome to view them in-situ at the [site's Github repository](https://github.com/quantumgardener/qg.blog). The majority are to support [[Designing The Quantum Garden]] and others are purely informational/cosmetic.

### Generate RSS for only certain pages
By default [[Quartz 4]] considers every page for RSS inclusion. That doesn't suit the way I write and use content. Some is reference, other is commentary and there is too much reference material to blog it. I've modified the RSS generation to only include files in the `/blog` folder.
- `quartz\plugins\emitters\contentIndex.ts`
	- Code in feed location, copyright year from start to dynamic current year and filter for only files that start with `rssRootFolder`
- `\quartz.config.ts` - to set up RSS and pass through the root folder "blog" - look at `Plugin.ContentIndex` emitter parameters.

### Remove Links to Pages That Don't Exist
I believe it's poor design to link to any pages that I can know don't exist.
- `\quartz\plugins\transformers\ofm.ts`

### Hide Tags From the Graph View
At this stage of the garden's development this hides the fact that many pages are not as inter-linked as they should be.
- `\quartz.layout.ts`

### Force All URLs and Links to Lower Case
For future proofing as mixed case URLs only cause problems when page names change.
- `\quartz\plugins\transformers\ofm.ts`
- `\quartz\util\path.ts`

There is also a custom rule applied to Cloudflare to convert all incoming URLs to lower case for any off-site references except if the file is `/static/contentIndex.json` as that breaks Search.

### Hide Folder Structure
The folder structure behind the site doesn't add as much value as good writing and linking.
- `\quartz.layout.ts`

### Automatically Show Social Icons for Social Links in Footer
Save me some work for any new social links in the footer. Solving for this change improved my [[Javascript]] knowledge.
- `\quartz\components\Footer.tsx`
- `\quartz.layout.ts`

### Format Dates to my Liking
Some small configuration options. Note that dates are no longer being shown as part of [[Designing The Quantum Garden]].
- `\quartz\components\Date.tsx`

### Display a Note's Growth Status
Display [[Seedling]], [[Budding]] or [[Evergreen]] status -- Automated from a `growth` property on each page in preference to using tags because the purpose of the information is different.
- `\quartz\components\ContentMeta.tsx`

### Display .webp images
Include images for the new compressed web image format.
- `\quartz\plugins\transformers\ofm.ts`

### Display Tag Icon as Part of Tag Link
Display tags with a icon rather than a `#`
- `\quartz\components\PageLiist.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\TagList.tsx`

### Tag Pages List Their Tags
Tag pages can themselves be tagged and show the list of their tags.
- `\quartz\components\pages\TagContent.tsx`

### Tag Pages Hide Their Tag Name from Linked Items
If you are on a tag page, the list of notes with that tag no longer display the name of the page itself. It's completely redundant information.
- `\quartz\components\PageLiist.tsx`

### Landscape Index pages
Add pages to index all notes within one or more [[Landscapes]].
- `\quartz\quartz.config.ts`
- `\quartz\components\index.ts`
- `\quartz\components\ContentMeta.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\pages\LandscapeContent.tsx`
- `\quartz\plugins\emitters\index.ts`
- `\quartz\plugins\emmiters\landscapePage.tsx`
- `\quartz\plugins\transformers\frontmatter.ts`

### Change tags folder to topics folder
I prefer topics over tags. Possibly could have done this with a site redirect, but I like this way better. Fixes it at the root.
- `\quartz\components\Explorer.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\PageList.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\RecentNotes.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\TagList.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\pages\LandscapeContent.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\pages\TagContent.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\scripts\graph.inline.ts`
- `\quartz\plugins\emitters\folderPage.tsx`
- `\quartz\plugins\emitters\tagPage.tsx`
- `\quartz\plugins\transformers\ofm.ts`
- `\quartz\util\path.test.ts`

### Replace topic indicator for topics that don't have a dedicated note
The default is to say "Topic: abcd". Now the [FontAwesome Message icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/message?f=classic&s=regular) is displayed instead, and throughout the site for all topic labels.
- `\quartz\components\Articles.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\PageList.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\TagList.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\pages\LandscapeContent.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\pages\TagContent.tsx`

### Growth Maturity Index pages
Add pages to index all notes with their maturity level of [[Seedling]], [[Budding]], or [[Evergreen]].
- `\quartz\quartz.config.ts`
- `\quartz\components\index.ts`
- `\quartz\components\ContentMeta.tsx`
- `\quartz\components\pages\GrowthContent.tsx`
- `\quartz\plugins\emitters\index.ts`
- `\quartz\plugins\emmiters\GrowthPage.tsx`
