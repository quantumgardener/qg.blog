![[tv_Band of Brothers.webp|media-cover]]

I first saw Band of Brothers on TV, then DVD, then Blu-ray. A 4K version would be visually amazing.

This is a TV series I could watch all day long. It is engaging and scary at the same time. Episode 7, "The Breaking Point" is the most outstanding commentary on leadership failure I've ever seen.

Sadly, [[The Pacific]], as a sister series was not as good.
