Each week, normally on the last day I'm working I undertake a [[Getting Things Done]] weekly review.

It is an important grounding process to make sure I have not missed anything important, and to create clarity about what is coming due in the future.

> [!INFO] Where are the screenshots?
> I'd love to be able to include screenshots for each section below. However, I use this system at work and everything would be confidential. All you'd see is a blur anyway. 
## 1. Inbox zero
I mostly achieve [[Inbox zero]] each week. There are always one or two emails left mostly because the email contains information I know that I'll need soon. There will always be a project or next action to deal with it. This is a happy medium for me. I normally run a very lean inbox anyway because [[My inbox is not my filing cabinet]].

## 2. Check @overdue
Each morning I check my [[@overdue]] list so by the time I get here for a weekly review, it's usually ok. Just in case, I have an explicit check. [[@overdue]] is a page that uses the [[Dataview (Obsidian Plugin)]] to perform two queries. One for task I had to do yesterday (or earlier), and another for items overdue from others.

I've included the code I use below. Copy this into your own overdue page.

## 3. @today
Similar to [[@overdue]] I have an [[@today]] page that brings to my attention items I've scheduled for today. My past has been a longstanding battle between knowing that [[Adding a due date to your tasks is a mistake]] and  [[Committing to tasks without dates]] but the habit is strong. The ultimate purpose is to remind me of something I've pre-thought needs doing today, so why not let the system tell me.

Why check for what's due today? It gives me a grounding when reviewing projects, and also protects against me starting a weekly review late in the day and leaving myself no time to do something that **had** to happen today.

By design [[@today]] does not include items that are overdue. Cognitively it helps me to have this clear separation. It **requires** I have the discipline to check.

I've included the code I use below. Note how I use [Modular CSS Layout](https://efemkay.github.io/obsidian-modular-css-layout/) to add some quick links across the top â€” including a link to [[@overdue]]. You can guess what [[@tomorrow]] does. The same as @overdue but for the future. At work I have an [[@monday]] as well.

## 4. @long term waiting
So, not everybody gets back to me with what they have promised. To be honest, that can be a good thing if I'm busy ðŸ¤£. The [[@long term waiting]] page is one I check every few days just in case. It brings all my `#wf` items together organised by age.

The question I'm answering here is, "Do I still need this? If so, who do I need to give a kick up the arse to get something finished!"

I've included the code I use below. This serves as a good example of what you can do with [[Dataview (Obsidian Plugin)]] and some playing around. Line 9 demonstrates how I tag tasks with dates. On 2024-06-05, this would have appeared on the [[@today]] page.

## 5. @next actions
By this point I've checked everything that's overdue or due today. What about those other actions I have committed to work on? I check the list of every non-`#wf` task in my system. It's always a pleasant surprise to find some I've done and missed checking off.

I've included the code I use below. Note line 3 where I exclude tasks in my templates. They aren't valid for this list.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/quantumgardener/c3f728086c936f822fde3bd9d0a29d61.js"></script>
## 6. @active projects
This is the part of my weekly review that takes the longest.[^1] For every project that is due for review, I open it up and check the next actions, add any missing actions or close it if I need to. I then set the reviewed date to today causing it to drop off the list. I usually pin this page otherwise opening a link in my system causes it to close.

I've included the code I use below. Lines 4â€“9 provide a count of **all** projects. Lines 11â€“17 list all projects that are active and due for review. `date_reviewed` is a property on all my projects.

## 7. @pending projects
Similar to [[@active projects]] this is a quick check of projects marked `#status/pending`. Do they need to be activated now?




	- pending projects
	- @no next-action
	- Past 2 weeks of calendar
	- Upcoming 6 weeks of calendar
	- Check QA
	- Inbox folder filing
	- learnings and highlights
	  Include [[reviewed]] template code and [[@active projects]]
