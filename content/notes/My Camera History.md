My earliest memories of a camera come from my Dad and the 35mm SLR camera he had when I was young. The detachable lens, film canister and dust blower all fascinated me. I'm pretty sure it was a Canon as I've always associated that with cameras.

When I was in primary school, the wonder of the house was a Polariod camera with with self-developing film.

The first camera I had under my control was my Mum's [Kodak Instamatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instamatic) with [126 film cartridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/126_film) and a flash bulb. I took it to Tasmania on the Year 10 school tour.

When I went to Denmark in 1988 I took with me a no-brand fixed focus 35mm camera that had pretty much 3 buttons. One to shoot, one to open the back for film and one to open the battery compartment. I took almost 1,000 photos with that camera.

My first real camera was a [Canon EOS500N](https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/film190.html). It was a Christmas present in 1998 for our trip to the UK. As a beginner with lots of buttons to play with, I managed to take a lot of good photos.

Upon our return from the UK, digital had arrived and the 500N was traded in for a Sony Cybershot Sony DSCP72. A whopping 3.2 megapixel camera but perfect for new parents.

In 2006 I purchased a [[My Photography Gear|Canon 400D]] which has remained my camera ever since -- with a number of smartphone cameras along the way.
