**[[literature note|Literature notes]]** are a key note product within a [[zettelkasten]] system[^1]. There are differing points of view on exactly what makes a literature note. What is clear, is the note is piece of connective [[note taking]] tissue between an original source document and the [[permanent note|permanent notes]] that it feeds into.

The note should be written from memory, and not simply copied from the source.
## One note per source
[[Bob Doto]] argues the [[literature note]], better called a "reference note"[^2] is a summary of the information found in a source[^3]. The literature note serves as a list of the key points the author found interesting and needs a reference back to. It can also serve as a placeholder for thoughts that arise during reading/watching.

Clearly identify the source, use references where possible, and if not possible, keep notes in the order they appear in they are captured. Topical references can be added as they are thought of.
## One note per idea
Ahrens[^1], and others[^4], prefer to create a separate literature note for each idea they find relevant in the source. This dramatically slows up the initial reading process and offloads the [[reference note]] function to [[fleeting note|fleeting notes]] and confuses their function.
## Permeance of literature notes
[[literature note|Literature notes]] are permanent. They are designed to act as a link between [[main note|main notes]] and to be sources of future inspiration.

[^2]: I'm sticking with the name "literature note" rather than "reference note" as it is the term I'm hearing for notes taken with respect to a source. Doto is themselves inconsistent and uses "literature note" in other articles (see [[Doto (2022) -- What is a Permanent Note (Correcting Some Common Misunderstandings)]]).
