The first I knew was an email saying my $5 donation to running the mastodon.au server was refunded. I inquired to be told the server was scheduled for shutdown in 3 months.

I’d have been happy for the moderators to keep the money, but that’s the nature of Mastodon over Twitter. One refunds the money, the other wouldn’t even tell you it was turned off.

I’ve moved to [@dcbuchan@aus.social](https://aus.social/@dcbuchan) now. The process was quite easy. All followers were moved automatically once I linked the new and old accounts and it was simple to export/import who I followed and my bookmarks. Unfortunately my 130 posts don’t transfer across. I understand that would be troublesome and open to abuse. The only other changes I otherwise needed to make were the links on [The Quantum Garden](https://quantumgardener.blog).
