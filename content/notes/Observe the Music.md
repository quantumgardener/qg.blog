Changing how we observe our world by becoming a different observer is powerful. A power that gives us more choice.

If you ever need reminding that observing differently can make a difference to how you feel in your soul you can:

- Listen to a favourite piece of music in a different location, on better headphones, or in a dark room.
- Listen to a remix or remaster - I recently closely listened to [[Mike Oldfield|Mike Oldfield’s]] _[[Tubular Bells]]_. I hadn’t realised it was a remix of the original music and not just a remaster.[^1]
- Listen to the [[Dolby Atmos]] mix of a favourite album, if available, on Apple Music with [Spatial Audio](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT212182). Pink Floyd’s _A Momentary Lapse of Reason (Remix 2019)_ is currently doing it for me and is the prompt for this post.

A little change in how you observe the world can make all the difference. As they say, “A journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step."

[^1]: For the record I didn’t like it that much. The original is wired into my nervous system after hundreds of listens over 35 years.
