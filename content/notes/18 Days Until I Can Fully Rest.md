I’m now down to 18 work days before I get 2 weeks off work over Christmas/New Year.

It’s important that I relax and look after myself.

It’s tempting to think of all the:

- Books I can read
- TV I can watch
- Movies I can watch
- Video games I can play
- Kilometres I can walk
- Places I can visit
- Miniatures I can paint
- Photos I can categorise

but the risk is I spend my holiday busy.

More than anything I need to still my mind, That’s where the true relaxation and recuperation will come from.
