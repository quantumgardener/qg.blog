[[First-order learning]] is the typical approach to [[Learning]] where, following unexpected results, we review our behaviour and what we did wrong to cause the result. The premise is rooted in action as the predicate: change the action, change the result.

In contrast, [[Second-order learning]] is an observation of our [[Way of Being]] to learn how we selected those behaviours, and desired results, in the first place.
