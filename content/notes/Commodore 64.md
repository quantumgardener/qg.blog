It is hard to say just how much the [[Commodore 64]] means to my life. One day [[Ron Buchan|Dad]] announced he was bringing home a C64, screen, printer and disk drive. There was a sales competition amongst Holden dealers and either he snaffled it, or nobody else wanted it. Dad was the accountant, not a sales person.

I cut my teeth programming on the C64. First in Basic and later assembler.

I played so many [[Commodore 64 games]] with my friends I have many fond memories. Damien and I scoring the same time in [[Pitstop II]], when one of us one visually, only to race again, and score the same time again, with the other visually ahead. My favourite memory is of Christmas morning 1983, when everyone had left the house to play with new toys in the park across the road, and I was left in the house playing [[Culture Club]]'s [[Colour by Numbers]] on tape as I loaded up [[Zork I]] to stand by the mailbox for the very first time.

Suffice to say, amongst the 6 of us in the family, practically this was my computer.
