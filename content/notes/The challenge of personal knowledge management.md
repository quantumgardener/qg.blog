I wonder if the greatest challenge of knowledge management is not one of technology limitations nor the ability to transcode knowledge from our heads to paper yet simply human nature. Jim McGee says

> The problem with getting more leverage out of knowledge work isn't somewhere out there in the organization. It's looking back at me in the mirror every morning. Worse than that, it's that lazy slob I was looking at in the mirror six months ago who was too busy then to put a halfway decent name on a file or save that really great diagram as its own file.

> What does this have to do with weblogs? Weblogs put the emphasis where I believe it belongs; on the individual knowledge worker. It encourages them to begin thinking about their own knowledge work more explicitly and systematically. It helps them realize that they are the problem and the solution. You have to learn how to share knowledge with yourself over time before you can begin to share it effectively with others. [[Jim McGee - Sharing Knowledge with Yourself](http://www.mcgeesmusings.net/2003/03/17.html#a3082)] 

Even if the technology doesn't come to our aid with magnificent search engines that understand our every desire, the act of thinking about our knowledge for even a fraction of a second, serves to hardwire it a bit deeper into our memory. We become aware of what we know. And let's face it, until we know what we know how can any knowledge management effort work.
