![[vg_it_takes_two.webp|media-cover]]
A two-player co-op game about relationships and 2021's Game of the Year. I'm playing it with [[Wendy Buchan|Wendy]]. It's the first real console game she's ever played so there is the added level of me supporting her learning. We've killed our first boss and are working well together.
