![[vg_astro_bot.webp|media-cover]]

Given to me by [[Hannah Buchan|Hannah]] for Christmas 2024 and eagerly looked forward to. I finished the main campaign on [[2025-01-04|4 January 2025]] and have begun the clean-up on the way to the [[Platinum trophy]]. At the end of the credits you couldn't wipe the grin off my face.

I have to improve a lot on some of the one-off challenge levels if I'm to succeed. There is an element of [[Elden Ring]] repetition.
