**Evergreen** is a [[digital garden]] concept, used to mark articles that are published publicly as being complete with an expected long-term life of relevancy. Articles can begin as [[seedling|seedlings]], [[budding]], or even in their final status dependent on how much development work is done in private vs public.

The term is also used in [[marketing]] to categorise articles which are expected to, or have, relevance over the long term.

See [[The Value of Growth Maturity in a Digital Garden is Marginal]] for a discussion of why notes are not marked [[evergreen]] in this [[digital garden]].
