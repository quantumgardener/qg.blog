There is a growing list of people I'm following on YouTube who are my go-to for learning about photography. They are all people I can imagine spending the day with.

| Photographer                                                   | What I'm Learning                                                                                                                                                           |

| [Henry Turner](https://www.youtube.com/@HenryTurnerphoto)      | More than anything Henry provides enthusiasm for photography. His tips are always set against the background of joy for what he's doing.                                    |
| [Ian Worth](https://www.youtube.com/@ian_worth)                | Ian has a lot of practical "in the field" tips.                                                                                                                             |
| [Mike Smith](https://www.youtube.com/@mikesphotography)        | Mike has taught me a lot about taking panoramas.                                                                                                                            |
| [Joshua Peg](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJoshuaPeg)            | Joshua provides reflection on his own learnings in a relatable way.                                                                                                         |
| [Mark Denney](https://www.youtube.com/@MarkDenneyPhoto)        | Though I don't like the results of Mark's editing tutorials (his creative choices result in picture that look unreal to me), his other videos are full of practical advice. |
| [Simon d'Entremont](https://www.youtube.com/@simon_dentremont) | A Canadian wildlife photographer with many years of experience on the finer detail.                                                                                         |
| [Alex Kilbee](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePhotographicEye)     | Alex has a strong photographic art background and the non-landscape lens is another way for me to understand the concepts.                                                  |
