Our *Way of Being* is an ever-changing interplay of language, emotions and body that determines silently and invisibly how we observe the world and so dictates the set of behaviours we have available in the moment[^1]. [[Way of Being is not the same as behaviour]].

It is a core concept within [[The Ontology of the Human Observer]].

Understanding our [[Way of Being is a core domain of learning]]. Since we exist in many family, work and social organisations, this is about how we live a quality and fulfilling life.
