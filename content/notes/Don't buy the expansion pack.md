It is tempting if you come to something late, to buy the Game of the Year Edition, the full Omnibus, or Complete Series of whatever game, book series or movie you are interested in.

This is a mistake. It can lessen the experience of discovery when everything is put before you.

Buy the base on offer and expand when you are ready. It might cost you a few more dollars, but you'll be richer for the experience.
