We have a state election on [[2022-11-19|Saturday]]. One local candidate sent a letter to our household today. We have four that will be voting.

They could have sent a letter each.

They could have sent it to “Dear voter"

Instead, they sent one letter to all four of us, by name and the address had “The Buchan Family”.

That is the best mail merge I have ever seen.
