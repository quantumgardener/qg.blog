![[vg_The Last of Us Part II.webp|media-cover]]
A tour-de-force of gaming experience and fitting sequel to [[The Last of Us]]. Very emotional and challenging when making decisions about what is right and what is justified. Shows the full power of gaming.

I finished my first play-through very close to the game's initial release and on [[2025-01-19|19 January 2025]] I finished a run on the [[PlayStation 5]]. The experience was different and though not as emotional as the first time, still hits hard at the end.
