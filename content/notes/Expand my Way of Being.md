[[Ontology]] is both the study of being and the concepts and ideas in a field of study. I use [[The Ontology of the Human Observer]] extensively as a framework for my understanding of how interact with the world.

[[Ontological coaching]] helps people with their [[Ontological learning]] by giving them a set of [[Distinction|Distinctions]] that provide them with insight into their current [[Way of Being]] and create the potential for an [[Ontological shift]]

My personal experience of my [[Way of Being]] is a valuable source of learning for me.

Conversation is a fundamental part of human existence. The [[Types of conversation]] we have, the calibre of those conversations, and any [[Missing Conversations]] has a significant impact on the quality of our lives. Our adeptness at [[Conversational technology]] such as [[Basic linguistic acts]] and the [[Promise Cycle]] sits within our [[Way of Being]].

[[Coaching and mentoring are different]]. The focus of a coach is to help a coachee observe their [[Way of Being]] and make adjustments that benefit them. Mentors tend to drop their experience on others as the right and only way to do things. With this approach, a mentor has fallen into the trap of [[Arrogance]].
