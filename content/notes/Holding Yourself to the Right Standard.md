Let’s say I'm measuring my behaviour, success, etc. and I fail to meet the ideals of the standard I'm comparing to. I will either:

1. Feel inadequate because I am not good enough.
2. Put unrealistic pressure on myself to close the gap.

There is a third choice. Almost always overlooked. Adjust the standard to something that’s realistic for me at this point in time.
