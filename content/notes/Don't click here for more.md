Catering to the lowest common denominator is a problem. It assumes we can identify what or whom the lowest common denominator is. Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman raises this question when he speaks of [the pointlessness of click here links](http://www.ashbykuhlman.net/blog/2002/11/17/0027) 

> "Television stations do not tell viewers how to operate their remote controls. Newspapers do not instruct readers in removing papers from delivery bags. It'?'s time news Web sites stopped telling readers how to operate links".

Kuhlman suggests the the lowest common denominator is higher than most web developers/writers cater for and therefore 'click here' links are redundant. Read further to the comments on his post and you'll notice people in violent disagreement. I found those speaking about a call to action the most interesting.

I prefer to follow Kuhlman's directives where possible. It feels awkward to leave a sentence with a hanging "you can find it here". My personal site  is notorious for this. Back to the lowest common denominator. Where do we set the bar? Perhaps there is a need for a 'click here' link on a site when it takes the reader to a site on how to use web browsers.
