The three ontological domains are:

- [[The domain of language]]
- [[The domain of emotion]]
- [[The domain of body]]

We exist **simultaneously** in all three domains, though we can be tricked into thinking of them in isolation and as a hierarchy because they are linearly introduced in the order shown above[^1].
