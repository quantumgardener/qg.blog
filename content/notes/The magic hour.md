I have a lot of projects in my personal life which are so time-hungry it's not possible to sit down and complete them in any one evening, weekend, or week on holiday. They are:

- Cataloguing my home photos in [[IMatch]]
- Keeping up with organising the knowledge in my personal knowledge management system, let alone using it to create new insights and knowledge
- Completing a [[Danish ships cross-stitch]] I purchased in April 2000

The idea of applying an hour of my time each day first came when considering my data in [[Obsidian]]. Simply getting my existing store of typed information organised is a lot of work and I can only do so much before it becomes tiresome. Never mind linking and creating knowledge or writing new content.

One hour per day equates to 365 hours per year. For my 38-hour work week, that's 9.6 weeks of effort.

From working for 30 years I have a strong internal sense of what 9.6 weeks, **full time** on a project would produce. The impact on my personal knowledge management system would be incalculable.

All for an hour a day.
