![[vg_Middle Earth - Shadow of Mordor_t.webp]]
It's fair to say that the Lord of the RIngs spin-off, *Shadow of Mordor* will always hold a special place in my gaming heart. Not only did I throroughly enjoy the game and appreciate the mechanics, but it's the first game for which I ever achieved a [[Platinum Trophy]] something I never thought I'd be able to do.
