## A Thief's End

This (almost) final game in the series pulls together all that has been learned along the way and all the character development. Chapter 11 has the most amazing chase scene in a game ever, and finishes with one of the most emotional moments I've ever seen in a game. Perfect motion capture. And it sets up a tension that continues for many of the following chapters. You can view that [here on YouTube - warning spoilers](https://www.youtube.com/embed/oddTgSLUi9U).
