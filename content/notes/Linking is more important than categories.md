Non-hierarchical, non-directional linking between notes provides better information over time than hierarchical categorisation. Categories must by their nature focus on one phenomenon of a thing and therefore are restrictive compared to rich linking in multiple directions.

[[Backlink|Backlinks]] "may" be used to infer hierarchy, but it cannot be guaranteed that is the case. They are more likely to reflect the order notes were created.
