The multi-purpose nature of [[The Quantum Garden]] system of organising and connecting notes means it is important to have strong understanding and taxonomy of the different types of notes in use. Each has an important role to play, but will different in nature and lifecycle.

The need to distinguish note types comes from the work I've had to put in to understand the difference between [[fleeting note|fleeting notes]], [[Literature note|literature notes]] and [[Permanent note|permanent notes]] in a [[Zettelkasten]] structure[^1],[^2]

I have a mix of notes that are personal, historical, shareable, instructional, index, and source. Some are even multiples of these[^3]. 

- [[Main note]] - a note stored in `Atlas/notes` or `Quartz/notes`[^quartz]. 
- [[Literature note]]  - a note made directly against an item of source material such as a book, article or video. These are tagged `#literature-note` and stored in `Atlas/reference/sources`
- [[Map of content]] - a note linking other notes together. These are tagged `#moc` and are stored in `Atlas/reference/maps`
- [[Journal entry]] - a personal journal entry. These are tagged `#journal`[^journaltags]  and are stored in `Calendar/Journal`. [[Blogs are public journal entries]].

All notes should be treated as [[Permanent note|permanent notes]] by default to avoid breaking connections across the graph of knowledge.
