## Among Thieves

If you've played this, then "train scene" is all I need to say. A masterpiece at the time it was launched, Uncharted 2 still holds up easily today, especially in the remastered edition.

Sequel to [[Uncharted - Drake's Fortune]].
## Among Thieves (Remastered)

Playthrough was on hard difficultly.
