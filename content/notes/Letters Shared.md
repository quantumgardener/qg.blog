↖️ [[Letters with Jason]]

This morning I read [a series of letters between Robb Knight and Jason Becker](https://rknight.me/letters/). They came about as part of project Jason is undertaking to have conversations with others in the old form of letters (even if written by email).

If you take the time to follow the link above and read the letters as posted you will see a pattern of conversation that I’ve observed often happens when people get to know each other. They start with something mundane (weather, family, where they live, job etc.) and over time get deeper and deeper into each other’s lives and interests.

**It is critical we allow ourselves the time to converse human to human.**

We so sadly lack this in the majority of our conversations today. There is no time to deal with anything other than the immediate. If writing letters back-and-forth is the way to start it is worth doing. Though it isn’t the form that ultimately matters. It is the focus and intention of the conversation. 

Jason and Robb set out to have a conversation purely for the sake of conversation. Neither knew where it would lead, and as far as I know, neither had an agenda of topics going in.

I’m jealous.
