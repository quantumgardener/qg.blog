The pros and cons between title-case and lower-case [[tag note]] names are fairly even. Title-case is a clear indication of a concept, but lower-case reads better when text is copied from this system into another. For that reason I've decided to go with lower-case. In cases where there is a constant mix of case around a particular note I can use the alias function. This will occur less frequently if I begin with lower-case.
