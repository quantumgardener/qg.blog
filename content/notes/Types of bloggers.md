- Observational - people who observe the world and make comment on it through their experience as a way to prompt thinking in others. A great example is [The Obvious? – Euan Semple's Weblog](https://euansemple.blog/). I'd put [PostSecret -](https://postsecret.com/) in this group as well.
- News aggregators - people with interest in a field, company or product who bring scan for the latest news of interest. An example is [The Loop (loopinsight.com)](https://www.loopinsight.com/) which is primarly Apple news based, but not completely.
- Products/Reviewers- details on which are the best products. Can be corporate e.g., [PlayStation.Blog – Official PlayStation Blog for news and video updates on PlayStation, PS5, PS4, PS VR, PlayStation Plus and more.](https://blog.playstation.com/) (look at that title) oir
- How-to'ers - anyone who blogs about how to blog! A lot of the content on [Jamie Todd Rubin – Writer (jamierubin.net)](https://jamierubin.net/) is an excellent example of how-to blogging^[Refer to the series [Practically Paperless with Obsidian](https://jamierubin.net/2021/10/05/practically-paperless-with-obsidian-episode-1-the-basics-notes-and-documents/)].
- Agenda pushers - I can't give you an example of this type of blog as I don't follow any. Quite sure they will be there.
