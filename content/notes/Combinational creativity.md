Creativity does not come from a muse. It all comes from combining pre-existing ideas. That's important because it means you can make a process out of being creative. It can be driven, rather than waiting for inspiration.[^1]

Ingesting good ideas to combine comes from reading and accessing the experience of others[^2].
