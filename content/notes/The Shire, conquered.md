I began walking [The Shire Virtual Challenge](https://www.theconqueror.events/shire/) challenge last month and later this week I will complete the 233km distance from Hobbiton to Bree. It is the last Lord of the Rings challenge I will do.

My wife's experience of walking Rome, London and Paris with Streetview meant something to look at each stop. My walk followed a line on a very sparse map with a few screenshots from the movie. I felt no progress but that is what I was after. I need something to motivate me to walk beyond adding kms. The only destination I have is the end. No journey.

*An unexpected, boring, journey*

Whichever walk I do next, it will be one with Streetview.
