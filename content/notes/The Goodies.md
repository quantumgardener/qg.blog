Where do I start explaining how much Tim, Graeme and Bill mean to me. The Goodies was a staple of my childhood, airing regularly during the early-80s around tea time. I was drawn to the use of language and witty banter that was a hallmark of the show. Only on later viewings did I come to appreciate the slapstick routines set to music in the middle of each episode.

Obviously I was saddened to hear of the death of Tim Brooke-Taylor due to [[COVID-19]].

My favourite [episodes of The Goodies episodes - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Goodies_episodes) are:
- S01E06 - Cecily
	- A truly creepy episode that still weirds me out today.
- S01E07 - Radio Goodies
	- Who doesn't love a walk through The Black Forest.
- S02E04 - The Lost Tribe
	- Best camping gear ever

	- "Ecky-Thump" is a beautifully crafted episode.
- S05E12 - [Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunfight_at_the_O.K._Tea_Rooms)
	- My absolute favourite episode from the discovery of scones, jam and cream at the start, through to the toast poker and the tomato sauce fight at the end.
