I have returned to J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings (LOTR) for the first time since seeing the [Peter Jackson movie versions](http://www.lordoftherings.net). Strangely the experience is not what I expected.

When such a famous and much-loved book is converted to film there are two fears.
- The movie does not do the book justice; and
- Imagination is forever clouded/tainted/destroyed because we have someone else's vision in our heads

I have the special extended editions of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers (Return of the King due out next week) and so I am familiar with some of the challenges and necessary decisions made to bring the book to film (some 11 hours in total for the special extended editions). Some elements were cut, others extended and in the latter movies lines given from one person to another.

As I read LOTR it becomes clear the book and films are two tellings of the same story and although I am enjoying the book it is missing the emotion and colour, despite Tolkien's ability to describe his world so well.

- Gandalf says to Frodo, 'Keep it secret, keep it safe!' In the book a non-descript line. In the movie powerful because of the way it is delivered
- The book's introduction to Strider/Aragorn has little of the tenseness created in the movie.
- As I come across a line or scene in the book that is in the movie it jumps out in 3-dimensional colour.
- There is no music playing to scenes in the book

These points were unexpected. Yes, I do see the faces of Elijah Wood or Viggo Mortensen instead of what I would have imagined. That's ok because now they have faces. In the movie you see the faces, clothing, set decoration in each scene. That is only described once in the book when the character is first met.
Do I prefer one over the other? That's the wrong question. Do I enjoy both and recognise them for what they are? Yes.
