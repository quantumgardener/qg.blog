Over the last week I've been playing [[Uncharted - Legacy of Thieves Collection]] on the [[PlayStation 5]]. It has just been remastered for the new console with improved graphics.

The collection consists of [[Uncharted 4 - A Thief's End|Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]] and a shorter follow-up titled [[Uncharted - The Lost Legacy|Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]].

Both games, as with all in the series, are rollicking adventures full of fun, danger and emotion. Uncharted 4 has a moment that was as emotional and impactful as anything I've seen in the best movies. You can view that [here on YouTube - warning spoilers](https://www.youtube.com/embed/oddTgSLUi9U).

It makes me sad to think many will never experience what these games can bring, because they are "computer games" and so seen as beneath many people. I wonder if this is because they associate gaming (the biggest entertainment industry on the planet) with the computers they don't understand.

Not the same at all.
