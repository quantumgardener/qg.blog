66 blog posts so far this year. This will be number 67.

Lazybear completed `#100DayToOffload` challenge for 2024 and plans a [related 100 pics](https://lazybea.rs/the100pics/) challenge for 2025. Perhaps it's because I'm in the middle of uploading photos to [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcbuchan/) and [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.au/dcbuchan) that the idea of regular posting caught my eye, but it has been in my thoughts beforehand. Seeing a target of 100 consolidated my resolve.

As Lazybear suggests, 365 is too much and I know that. 100 is only 2 actions a week. That I can manage. My blogging rate has increased to about 10/month without trying.

It's about building habit and skill.

I commit to posting 100 images to my social accounts, because that will drive an improvement in my photo editing skills which is a [[MoSCoW|must do]] for 2025.

I commit to posting 100 blog posts, because that will drive an improvement in writing driven by a well cultivated [[Digital garden]]. Writing underpins my core personal development goal for 2025. I know that for certain, even though I'm not yet sure what that goal is. At least one blog per week will be substantial knowledge and not a pseudo-diary entry made public.

There are more 100x items that I could do. I'm wary of over-committing my time so I'll let them play out as they will.
