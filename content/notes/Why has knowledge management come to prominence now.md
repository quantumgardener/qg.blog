title: Why has knowledge management come to prominence now?

I was asked the other day why has knowledge management come to prominence now. There is a short answer that is summed up in that one word called "Internet".

Connectivity, capacity and access for all make it possible to share knowledge. But the point is - we always have and we always will. The Internet is change in means and mode, not a root cause.

I think knowledge management's prominence has deeper roots in an individual's need to learn at this point in history. People are finding they need to become more reliant and old ways don't serve them any more. We are no longer content to take what the boss gives us and seek greater choice. We are starting to see the need to learn again and that is best done in a community. Knowledge sharing/management is a community based activity.

The change we are facing is nothing new. Changes of this magnitude have happened before and will happen again (Industrial revolution anyone?). It's just this time around we have a name.
