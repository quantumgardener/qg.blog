[On the difference between blogs and discsussion forums](http://www.ozzie.net/blog/stories/2002/08/12/architectureMattersTheRebirthOfPublicDiscussion.html). Some people do not seem to be able to get their heads around the difference between blogs and discussion forums. To my mind, although at a surface level they have some similarities - at a deeper level they are fundamentally different.

There are two dimensions to their differences - the first the psychological dimension and the second the technology dimension. One of the major psychological differences is that you own your weblog - it is YOURS - and it represents a history of YOUR thinking - so you take pride in its ownership - something that does not make a lot of sense in a discussion forum. On the hand on the technology front; [Ray Ozzie](http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/0/8A7F86CCBE768E14802569F40078F32F/) sums up one of the major differences.
