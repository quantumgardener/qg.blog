**Obsidian** is primarily a note-taking tool that uses [[Markdown]] files for speed and flexibility. The official site is https://obsidian.md/.

Within Obsidian I document and link:
- Personal journal entries
- [[Digital Garden]] notes
- My consumption of books, movies and TV shows

This website is published directly from Obsidian using [[Quartz 4]].
