## Tips to Shooting Panoramas
Ideally use a tripod, but can be done handheld.

1. Get the exposure right
2. Set to shutter priority so that ISO and aperture don't change
3. Set white balance to anything other than AW
4. Focus
5. Set focus to manual so it doesn't change
6. Shoot with plenty of overlap
