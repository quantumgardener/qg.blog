title: Are you feeling lucky?
---

Can you make your own luck by changing your language? "[How to make your own luck"](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/72/realitycheck.html) says so although not so directly. It seems that one of the main differences between the lucky and the unlucky is their listening to the world they live in. Take this story from the article as an example.

> We had a subject named Carolyn. When she would come to the unit to be interviewed, it would be just this whole string of bad-luck stories: "I can't find anyone. I'm unlucky in love. When I did find someone, the guy fell off his motorbike. The next blind date broke his nose. We were supposed to get married, and the church burned down." But to every single interview, she'd bring along her two kids. They were 6 and 7 years old -- very healthy, very happy kids who'd sit there and play. And it was interesting, because most people would love to have two kids like that, but that wasn't part of her world, because she was unlucky in her mind.

An outsider would call my last few weeks lucky but I beg to differ. I worked hard at looking for opportunities and then taking the time to follow them up. Another example comes from a conversation with my sister. We were talking about the opportunities she couldn't find. After she explained what her goal was I listed 6 that I'd heard of in the previous couple of days.
