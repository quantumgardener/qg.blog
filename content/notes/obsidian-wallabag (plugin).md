The [huseyz/obsidian-wallabag](https://github.com/huseyz/obsidian-wallabag) is useful for importing articles directly from [[Wallabag]] into [[Obsidian]]. I only import notes that I have tagged `source/article` using my [[wallabag (import template)]].

I see this as a worthwhile project and am contributing small code changes where I can to improve the experience for new users.
