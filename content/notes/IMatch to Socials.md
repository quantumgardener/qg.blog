The **IMatch to Socials** system automates the addition, update and deletion of images between [[IMatch]] and [flickr](https://flickr.com) or [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org). I created it to reduce the time taken updating and managing photos across all three platforms.
## Features
- Uses metadata directly from the [[IMatch]] database and formats it (to my liking) for sharing with others.
- Processes photos from a dedicated "Socials" category within [[IMatch]] and adds any new photos to the matching social platform.
- Updates photos flagged for update.
- Deletes photos flagged for deletion.
- When the target platform is flickr, adds/removes the photo from albums and groups.
- When the target platform is pixelfed, provides alt-text alongside the photo.
- Can be run as an [IMatch app](https://www.photools.com/help/imatch/app_basics.htm) for processing without leaving [[IMatch]].

## Installation and Configuration

### Set up Code Environment
For this system to run you need:
- **Experience with code.** I cannot emphasise this enough. I have taken steps to automate and bullet-proof this system **as much as I can and as much as I need for my own purposes**. It may not be right for you. The system modifies data and **deletes** data. 

> [!warning] It is your responsibility to test how this system works for you and to support that testing with adequate backups for your needs.

- [[IMatch]] from https://www.photools.com (and this means Windows 10 or Windows 11)
- [Python](https://www.python.org) at least version 3.10
- For flickr
	- [Python Flickr API](https://stuvel.eu/software/flickrapi/)  - once you have Python installed run `pip install flickrapi`
	- TZ data for timezone manipulation - once you have python installed run `pip install tzdata`
- For pixelfed
	- [Mastodon.py](https://pypi.org/project/Mastodon.py/) - once you have Python installed run `pip3 install Mastodon.py`
	- Your own Pixelfed account and 'personal access token'
- Code downloaded from GitHub at https://github.com/quantumgardener/IMatch-to-Socials

### Get Your Application Keys
Create application keys and record the keys and secrets you're given. These will go into IMatch application variables.
- flickr: [The App Garden on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create)
- pixelfed: Settings | Applications | Create new Token

You do not need to set up both platforms if you are using only the one. However, you will either need to modify `share_images.py` or call the Python script with a 'flickr' or 'pixelfed' argument. This is what the [[#Configure IMatch App|IMatch App]] does.
### Create IMatch Application Variables
To remove private information from the code, and to allow for quick changes, the system uses [IMatch Application Variables](https://www.photools.com/help/imatch/index.html#var_basics.htm?dl=hid-15) for configuration.

![[imatch-to-socials-application-variables.webp]]

| Variable                             | Value                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| flickr_api_key                       | Your personal flickr API key                                  |
| flickr_api_secret                    | Your personal flickr API secret                               |
| flickr_is_family                     | 1 = set, 0 = unset                                            |
| flickr_is_friend                     | 1 = set, 0 = unset                                            |
| flickr_is_public                     | 1 = set, 0 = unset                                            |
| imatch_to_socials_python_script_path | Path to where you have installed the code                     |
| pixelfed_token                       | Your personal pixelfed app token                              |
| pixelfed_url                         | URL of your pixelfed site. Mine is https://pixelfed.au        |
| pixelfed_visibility                  | Pixelfed image visibility (public, unlisted, private, direct) |
> [!tip] There is some configuration in `config.py` but this is more generic. 
> You could move these variables to application variables if you wanted (or vice-versa).

> [!warning] The privacy values effect new images only.
> You may want to hide images during testing. You can manually change them in the platform later on if needed, or delete and upload again.
### Create IMatch Attributes
[IMatch Attributes](https://www.photools.com/help/imatch/index.html#attr_basics.htm) are a way of attaching non-image metadata to an image within IMatch. They are stored only in the database and never saved to the image file. This system uses them to tag if a photo has been uploaded and provide some information about that. 

It does not matter what the information stored is. All that matters is the existence, or not, of an attribute per platform with at least the id of the photo on the target platform.

![[imatch-to-socials-attributes.webp]]

| Set      | Name      | Type      | Must be Unique | Desc.                             |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| flickr   | posted    | Date      | No             | Date the image was uploaded       |
|          | photo_id  | Text      | Yes            | Unique photo id on flickr         |
|          | url       | Hyperlink | Yes            | Direct link to photo's page       |
| pixelfed | posted    | Date      | No             | Date the image was uploaded       |
|          | media_id  | Text      | Yes            | Unique photo media id on pixelfed |
|          | status_id | Text      | Yes            | Unique text id on pixelfed        |
|          | url       | Hyperlink | Yes            | Direct link to photo's page       |
On pixelfed, the "post" that you see is the status. The attached photo is the media.

> [!TIP] Manually Deleting
> If you delete the attribute record for an image, it will be uploaded anew. This could cause duplicates on your platform but is useful when testing.
### Create IMatch Categories
The steps are simple. Create a version of an image, and add that image to a category the script recognises and press go. The structure I have is `root|platform|actions, errors and filing`.

![[imatch-to-socials-categories.webp]]

- `Socials` is defined in `config.py` as `ROOT_CATEGORY`
- The second level categories are the platforms. This must match the name given in the `PlatformController` subclasses' `__init__` function and be consistently used.
- `__errors` is defined in `config.py` and has a sub-category for each error type.
- `_delete` and `_update` are self-explanatory. Images assigned to these categories are deleted or updated. Defined in `config.py`
	- An image in both will cause and error. Images are removed from these categories once the action is taken. Therefore:
		- For update, an image should be in both the platform and update category
		- For delete, an image should only be in the delete category.
- flickr also has `albums` and `groups`, These can be named anything, but obviously should match the flickr names. More important is to have the album or group identifier stored in the category's description. For example, the Toys & Games URL is `https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcbuchan/albums/72177720316352529/` with an ID of `72177720316352529`. That is shown in the category description.

### Configure IMatch App
> [!WARNING] Advanced topic
> This is an advanced topic that relies you understanding what the instructions I give below mean. It's beyond the scope of this document to explain all the details.

![[imatch-to-socials-imatch-app.webp]]

The code can be run from the command line or from with IMatch using an IMatch app. Here's how I set up mine.

1. Close IMatch
2. Place the [GitHub](https://github.com/quantumgardener/IMatch-to-Socials) code in a location of your choice. The `IMatch app` folder is the one we are concerned with.
3. Create a symlink from the `C:\ProgramData\photools.com\imatch6\webroot\user` folder to the location of your `IMatch App` folder.
4. Start IMatch. You **should** see the application registered.
5. Point the `imatch_to_socials_python_script_path` application variable to the location where `share_images.py` is located.
6. ðŸ¤ž

### Versions and Metadata
My location hierarchy is quite deep and runs to personal information (see [[Mediabank]]). I don't want flickr to be creating keywords for my home address, but if the information is in the hierarchical keywords field in the uploaded file, it will. I attempted to get around this by deleting all keywords after an upload and though there were no errors, it didn't seem to work. Instead, I've set IMatch to not transfer keywords to versions of images. For some this will not be idea, but for me it works. The master image has all the keywording and versions have none. The script walks up from the version to the master, grabs the keywords from there, and then only sets the based on the in-code filters I have set up.

## Understanding the Code
### Main Code Loop (share_images.py)
What does this actually do? The main script `share_images.py` is a [[Python]] script that controls the main processing loop. There is a `platform_controller` for each platform (flickr, pixelfed). These gather `images` from [[IMatch]] and connect to the respective platforms for the API calls. In the pseudocode below an "image" is all the metadata associated with an image in IMatch.
```
build platform_controllers
FOR EACH platform_controller
	get images from IMatch with direct membership in Socials|[platform] cateogry
	classify images into add, update, delete, error or no-action categories
	add new images
	update existing images
	delete images
	process errors
END FOR
display processing statistics
```
### Classes
Most of the work is performed by 3 classes, with inherited versions for flickr and pixelfed.
#### `IMatchImage` (imatch_image.py)
> [!NOTE] Manages an images metadata
- `__init__` Pulls and stores common metadata from IMatch such as title, description, keywords and camera information. Traverses from the version in Socials to the master. flickr has a bad habit of creating keywords from personal information in the image file and try as I may, I can't delete it. In my system I don't propagate this information to the image version. Instead I use the code to get it from the master.
- `add_keyword` formats keywords to remove spaces, replace & etc
- `camera_info` makes some camera information consistent across devices. 
- `is_image_in_category` checks if an image, by it's `id`, is in a category or not. Primarily used to check for updates and deletes.
- `is_master` returns True if this is the master image and so an error
- `is_on_platform` checks if image has attributes for the platform as this is the marker it it has been previously uploaded. Must be overridden by  subclasses.
- `is_valid` returns True if the basic validity is met eg. not a master, has a title and description, has genre keywords
- `is_version` returns True if this is a version image
- `prepare_for_upload` filters and parses keywords and categories, cutting them down to those I am happy to share publicly. Extended by  subclasses.
- `shooting_info` standardises the way ISO, shutter speed, aperture etc are displayed
- `wants_delete` is this image in the `_delete` category
- `wants_update` is this image in the `_update` category

> [!caution] An image in both `_delete` and `_update` is flagged as an error and neither action is taken.
##### `FlickrImage` (flickr.py)
> [!NOTE] Extends `IMatchImage`
- `is_valid` flags an error if the image is > 200MB in size.
- `prepare_for_upload` extends parent class function. Formats text for flickr. Populates the list of albums and groups the image should be in.
##### `PixelfedImage` (pixelfed.py)
> [!NOTE] Extends `IMatchImage`
- `is_valid` flags an error if the image is > 15MB in size or if the 'headline' field is empty since this is used to populate the alt-text once uploaded.
- `prepare_for_upload` extends parent class function. Formats text for pixelfed. 

#### `PlatformController` (platform_base.py)
> [!NOTE] Manages a set of images, and the connection to the platform.
- `add_images` sends each image to the subclass controller to add to the platform
- `classify_images` adds images to buckets for add, update, delete and invalid handling
- `commit_add` does the actual add to the platform. Must be overridden by subclasses.
- `commit_delete` does the actual delete from the platform. Must be overridden by subclasses.
- `commit_update` does the actual update on the platform. Must be overridden by subclasses.
- `connect` makes a connection to the platform. Must be overridden by subclasses.
- `delete_images` requests deletion for each image from the platform and then removes images from the `_delete` category. If the image is only in this category, it will be gone from Socials.
- `process_errors` walk each subcategory of `__errors` and remove all currently assigned images from the last run, then add back all new errored (invalid) images
- `register_image` creates a connection between an `IMatchImage` and the controller. Simplifies code.
- `stats` is a small utility function to collate processing stats into a dict for easier display
- `summarise` display a summary of the controllers image counts as assigned by `classify_images`
- `update_images` does an update for each image on the platform. 

> [!TIP] Relationship between `commit_[action]` and `[action]_images` functions
> 
> There is strong relationship between each pairing functions. Those beginning with add, delete, and update iterate across the images and make a call to the commit function for each. The looping is common, but the calls to the final platform vary a lot. 
> 
> The iteration function also test for `config.TESTING`. If this is true, the commit function is bypassed.
##### `FlickrController` (flickr.py)
> [!NOTE] Extends `PlatformController`
- `__init__` collects privacy variables from IMatch (see [[#Create IMatch Application Variables]] below) and collects the album and group ids from the description field of the respective IMatch categories.
- `connect` connects to flickr. First run will authenticate via browser.
- `commit_add` adds an image to flickr in accordance with the privacy variables set. Adds the image to all albums and groups. Adds keywords as tags. Explicitly sets the date and time from the master metadata. Add attributes for the image so we know it's been added in the past.
- `commit_delete` deletes the image from flickr. The deletion proceeds without confirmation.
- `commit_update` replaces the image, updates the description and keywords and syncs album and group membership.
##### `PixelfedController` (pixelfed.py)
> [!NOTE] Extends `PlatformController`
- `connect` connects to pixelfed.
- `commit_add` adds an image to pixelfed
- `commit_delete` deletes the image from pixelfed. The deletion proceeds without confirmation.
- `commit_update` updates the description and alt-text. 
#### `IMatchAPI` (IMatchAPI.py)
> [!NOTE] Python wrapper for the [IMatch API](https://www.photools.com/developer-center/)
> Connects to [[IMatch]] which must be running for any of this to work. Contains API wrapper functions for only those functions needed. This is not Python for all of the calls that could be made.

See the code for details of each function. The basic process is to prepare all needed variables within the function, but allow for some to be passed in.

All functions are Python class functions.
#### `IMatchUtility` (IMatchAPI.py)
> [!NOTE] Support functions for `IMatchAPI` and other places where needed to do something specific for IMatch
- `build_category` takes a list of category path elements and builds a valid category string
```python
import IMatchUtility as iu

category = iu.IMatchUtility.build_category(['Socials','flickr','_delete'])
print(category) # Socials|flickr|_delete
```
- `prepare_filelist` takes a single IMatch file id, or array of ids, and turns them into a comma-separated string for passing through to the API.
