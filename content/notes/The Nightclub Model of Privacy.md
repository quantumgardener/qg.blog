Too many businesses collect personal information from individuals for their benefit. Under the guise of "providing better service" private data is held, often insecurely, well beyond it's need. If it was ever really needed at all.

I'd like to see business subscribe to the "Nightclub Model of Privacy". Check credentials at the door and allow or deny entry. Nightclubs don't keep a record of licence numbers, photos, birth dates or addresses. They don't need to.

Recently Wilson Parking in Melbourne wanted my address and date of birth to pre-book parking. There is no relationship between that information and the service. I didn't provide it. In reality they didn't even need my number plate. The credit card number I booked with was enough. Unless of course they wanted to tailor marketing information or sell it off.
