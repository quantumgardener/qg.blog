The focus of my hobbies at any point in time varies. At the moment I have keen interest in [[Photography]] with some [[Astrophotography]] attached.

There is plenty to see in my [[Map of video gaming]] which links out to all the games I've played one the gaming systems I've owned. Sometimes I also paint miniatures like I did when [[Painting Nagash]].

When I can afford it, I might also play with [[LEGO]].
