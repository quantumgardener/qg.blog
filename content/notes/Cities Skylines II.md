![[vg_cities_skylines_ii.webp|200]]

I've just begun playing the successor to [[Cities Skylines]] after building a PC that's capable of playing it. I had been waiting for the [[PlayStation 5]] version (still delayed) but won't bother.

My first city is a real mess. That's deliberate. I've been learning the tools and mechanics. There are improvements; roads especially that make everything smoother to play with.
