Delegation typically occurs because:

- We do not have the time to perform the task ourselves
- We do not have the skill to perform the task ourselves
- It is not our responsibility to complete the task, but it is our responsibility to ensure it is completed
- We could do it, but are developing the skill in others
- We're just lazy

Know which reason you are working to.
