I use the convention:
- [[Knowledge management]] means the management of the knowledge shared amongst the employees of an organisation. It includes operational, research and historical knowledge.
- [[Personal knowledge management]] refers to an individual's management of the knowledge they hold and will not distinguish between work- and home-life though there may be separate systems and home. The difference is the scope of who has access to the system.
