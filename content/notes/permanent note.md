A [[permanent note]] is a note that will remain in my [[digital garden]]. It is not inviolate and may be modified, but it should not be deleted[^1][^2]. When modifications are material, either update the note with an explanation of the change, or create a second note referring to the first.

A note with any of these tags in my system is a [[pernament note]]:

- `#concept` (see [[main note]])
- `#idea` (see [[main note]])
- `#instruction` (see [[main note]])
- `#literature-note` (see [[literature note]])
- `#reference` (see [[main note]])

The term is used widely when discussing [[zettelkasten]] but has more broad implications. An [[evergreen]] note is a type of permanent note.
