A [[permanent note]] is a note that will remain in my [[digital garden]]. It is not inviolate and may be modified, but it should not be deleted[^1][^2]. When modifications are material, either update the note with an explanation of the change, or create a second note referring to the first.

The term is used widely when discussing [[zettelkasten]] but has more broad implications. An [[evergreen]] note is a type of permanent note.
