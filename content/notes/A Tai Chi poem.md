In my search for a beginner Tai Chi class, I came across this poem.

> ”Remember, when moving,
> There is no place that doesn't move.
> 
> When still,
> There is no place that isn't still.
> 
> First seek extension, then contraction;
> Then it can be fine and subtle.
> 
> It is said "if others don't move,
> I don't move.
> 
> If others move slightly,
> I move first."

The last line resonates with me at this point in life. There is peace in the first 3 stanzas - a stillness and acceptance of things as they really are rather than what others in the world attempt to force us to see. Moving first, as per the last line, says to me something of taking control and responsibility for your own actions. Yet it also speaks of independence. You move a little (perhaps even showing me a way forward) and I'll move because I need and want to, not because you moved. I don't know the original source, however I found it in the newsletter of [Celestial Tai Chi of Australia](https://www.taichi-celestial.com.au/).
