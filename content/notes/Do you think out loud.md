title: Do you think out loud?
---
The [Minciu Sodas](http://www.ms.lt/) laboratory has [a survey on thinking out loud](http://www.ms.lt/openwork/doyouthinkoutloud.html). I think it appropriate to think out loud as I answer.

> In what forms do you think out loud?

I generally think out loud in face-to-face conversations with others. Other times I will use discussion groups. If I need to work out an idea privately I will tend to use tools such as "PersonalBrain" or "MindManager". Pen and paper also work for me.

> What do you think out loud about?

New ideas and concepts that don't yet make sense. Opportunities as well.

> Who do you consider your audience when you think out loud?

Other learners such as myself. People who can also benefit from the conversation. Audience implies one-way thinking. I believe it must be bi-directional to be of benefit.

> Please describe any tools, such as software, that you use, and why you find them helpful:
 
Blogging because the act of writing makes me think more carefully about an idea. When speaking you can be much looser about the subject matter. "PersonalBrain" helps me to organise ideas and identify convergence. "MindManager" is good for sharing concepts with others or restricting an idea to a particular focus.

> How does thinking out loud fit into your schedule?

It is generally unplanned and occurs as needed. However, I like to schedule regular Dialogue sessions with colleagues to create space for thinking.

> What kind of listeners do you find helpful? 
Learners.

> How do you find and keep listeners?

By remembering the conversation is give-and-take. Share what you have and listen to what they have to offer.

> How do you make use of your listener's reactions, state-of-mind, moods, tangents?

Take note and come back to them. If our moods are different I can learn by observation of the conversation itself.

> How do you prioritize your thoughts?

Whichever screams loudest in my head.

> What do you do when you're having trouble formulating your thought?
If I really can't get it I put it aside for later and let my sub-conscious sort it out. Sometimes I'll force the issue and request an answer of myself for when I wake in the morning. It usually works.

> What other activity does "thinking out loud" fit well with for you? 
Learning. Learning. Learning.

> In what ways do you or others come back to your thoughts?

Usually the thought comes back to us and raises a need for conversation when it is fit. No formal system.

> When do you let others share your thoughts freely, and when do you require that they ask for your permission?

As a rule, freely. If there is little trust however, I won't share.

> In your opinion, Why should people think out loud?

Because it means they are thinking rather than acting.

> How would you like your thoughts to affect others?

By creating a sense of possibility and ptimism.

> What kind of help or tools would you like there to be for thinking out loud?

Time and the means for people to realise the importance of thinking.
