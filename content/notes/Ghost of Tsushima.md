## Ghost of Tsushima (Original release)
![[vg_Ghost of Tsushima.webp|media-cover|200]]

This was one of those rare games which I saw the trailer for and knew I had to buy. It's a truly beautiful game and an engaging feudal Japan. Little is more satisfying than getting the buttons in order to slice your way through five opponents without them having a chance to fight back.

Jin, the main character in the game, was said by many to be emotionless. I never felt that. He was restrained, but the emotion was there all the way through.

Completed play through of base content on 22 August 2020 on the [[PlayStation 4]].
- Second [[Platinum trophy]] ever on 22 August 2020.

## Ghost of Tsushima (Director's Cut)

The Iki Island content provided a [[PlayStation 5]] version of [[Ghost of Tsushima]] with a story of Mongols staging Iki Island as an origin point for incursion into Tsushima.

I was immediately awarded another [[Platinum trophy]] because that's just the way it happens when you upgrade a game to the latest platform. I don't count that in my total of platinums earned.

I completed the main storyline in a few days.

I did attempt to play with Japanese language and subtitles. Couldn't read and play at the same time.
