Tags, or other similar metadata, added to resources in a [[personal knowledge management]] system are not content. They are best used to help you curate resources and can answer questions such as:

- What was written in July 2023? (add a date)
- Where are all the references to books? (add `#book`)
- What am I currently working on? (add `to-develop`)

When used as markers for the content of a resource - exactly like keywords - an issue arises where one tag can mean multiple things. Is `#philosophy` a reference to a note that discusses a philosophy, or is it about philosophy itself.

There is a difference between `tags`, `notes` and *[[tag note|tagnotes]]*[^1]. The latter are a flavour of note that summarise broad topics. They are similar to a [[map of content]] in that they bring together information with more context than a single word. Curtis writes,

In my system, I do not tag notes with markers of what knowledge is within them. If I am tempted to tag with a concept, I'll find a way to rewrite my text to use a `[[link]]` instead. Curtis stores these in a `Tags` folder and identifies them with a `#tagnotes` "proper" tag. I'm more likely to treat these as synonymous with [[map of content]] rather than as another point of friction to track.
