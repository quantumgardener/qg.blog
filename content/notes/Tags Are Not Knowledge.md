Tags, or other similar metadata, added to resources in a [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system are not content. They are best used to help you curate resources and can answer questions such as:

- What was written in July 2023? (add a date)
- Where are all the references to books? (add `#book`)
- What am I currently working on? (add `to-develop`)

When used as markers for the content of a resource - exactly like keywords - an issue arises where one tag can mean multiple things. Is `#philosophy` a reference to a note that discusses a philosophy, or is it about philosophy itself.

In [Tags or Links](https://curtismchale.ca/2021/07/26/obsidian-tagnotes/), [[Curtis McHale]] distinguished between `tags`, `notes` and *tagnotes*. The latter are a flavour of note that summarise broad topics. They are similar to [[Map of Contents|Maps of Content]] in that they bring together information with more context than a single word. Curtis writes,

> ## Tagnotes vs Notes
> The difference between `#tagnotes` and `notes` is that notes are summaries of reading and research Iâ€™ve been doing while `#tagnotes` are the connection points between that research.
>  
>  ## Tagnotes vs tags
>  When it comes to `#tags` I use those to set the status of a piece of research in my vault. Something I want to summarize gets `#tosummarize`. If I want `#toread` something then it gets that tag applied.
>  
>  I also use them to set the type of content. If I have a note on a specific person that note gets the `#people` tag. A note on an application like [[OmniFocus]] would get the `#app` tag. A note on a book gets the `#book` tag.

In my system, I do not tag notes with markers of what knowledge is within them. If I am tempted to tag with a concept, I'll find a way to rewrite my text to use a `[[link]]` instead.
