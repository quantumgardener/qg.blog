title: The mood of resignation
---
When possibility fails [[Resignation]] follows. Our choice of action is limited. Yet this often occurs because we fail to properly identify all possibilities, remaining constrained by our individual interpretation of the past. We will say to ourselves, "It can't happen" but never bother to check that [[Assessment|assumption]]. In this mood we must seek out others to generate new possibilities and cultivate new action. Or perhaps we seek Peace in knowing that what we thought was possible isn't for us at this time.
