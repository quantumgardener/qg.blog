The word "breakdown" has a negative connotation. It can correspond to something mental (and thankfully we are all more knowledgable about this now) or something physical (car, machinery, computer).

In the sense that I use [[Breakdown]], it means a breakdown in the transparency of life. What was expected to happen didn't. That's good because [[A breakdown is a learning opportunity]].
