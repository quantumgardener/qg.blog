The [Library of Congress Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification) is used as a guide for the [[Maps of Content]] naming strategy used here.
[[Maps of Content]] can take any form necessary to assist with the organisation of data.

1. The default storage location for [[Maps of Content]] is `\Atlas\Maps` in accordance with the design principles of the [[ACE Framework]].
2. Maps may be stored in other locations if that makes more sense. Some will be contextual with the knowledge they are mapping. It will often make more sense to tag a Map with `#MOC` in situ rather than tag and move it.
3. All [[Maps of Content]] are tagged `#MOC` irrespective of where they are stored.
4. The [[Home Life Index]] is a special [[Maps of Content]] that organises information with in the [[Johnny.Decimal]] system. Notes within its hierarchy are not tagged `#MOC`.
