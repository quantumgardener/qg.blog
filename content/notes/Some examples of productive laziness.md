Here are some examples to consider if you are looking at [[Quartz/maps/Productive laziness]].
* I need to regularly distribute reports to colleagues via a variety of OneDrive folders â€” being productively lazy means creating a small batch file to do the copying for me which I can call upon for each distribution update.
* Using text expansion tools to  such as [[Expanso]] [[How to enter dates quickly|enter dates quicky]] to shorten frequently used text phrases such as `d==` to a yyyy-mm-dd format date, eg. 2020-10-26. 
* Learning keyboard shortcuts and any other elements of software that can help in its use.
* Dealing with email once

These are simple examples of broader approach. The real benefit is not in time saved, but in thinking saved and that is important. Spending less effort and energy on something I already know how to do is important in maintaining my mental wellbeing.
