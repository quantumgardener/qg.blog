## My vision for 2025
In 2025 I will focus my efforts on [[Bringing Humanity to the Workplace]]. The idea has been circling quietly in my mind since around 2011. Every now and then I'd hear a louder whisper yet I never felt I had the resources to begin properly. Now I do.

We spend a large amount of our lives at work. Too much time is wasted failing to recognise the humanity in ourselves, others, and the situations we experience. I know we can do better.

The idea resonates strongly with me and those I've raised it with. I'm slowly realising that I have been building to this for many years. Gathering experiences, collating information and building the systems I need to support me. In July I cut back to 4 days a week to create space for me to develop my ideas into something shareable with others. I knew I needed the time. It has taken until now to hear the thread of purpose.

I'm deep in [[Wonder]] about where I'll be in 12 month's time and what I'll have created and shared via [[The Quantum Garden]]. In [[100 is the magic number]] I committed to 100 blog posts this year. At approximately 2 per week, one will be a significant piece on [[Bringing Humanity to the Workplace]]. 

## Holiday gardening
My photo library, [[Mediabank]], has undergone some big changes this last week. I removed the risk of uploading personal information when sharing photos to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcbuchan/) and [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.au/i/web/profile/550816042308286789). Location and event information previously stored in a photo's metadata has been moved to [[IMatch]] categories, and only the minimal information needed for the target site is added to the jpeg version. [[IMatch to Socials]] is the second best piece of code I've ever written and the ease of changes this week confirms that.

I've also improved my [[Affinity Photo 2|Affinity Photo]] editing skills. I can quickly remove scan lines from images, and colour correct yellow snow to white snow.

My [[Digital garden]] has also received attention. Today I refactored my templates for better note metadata after yesterday FINALLY integrating 60+ notes previously captured in [[Omnivore]]. 

Tomorrow it gets physical. The shed will get its annual clean out.
