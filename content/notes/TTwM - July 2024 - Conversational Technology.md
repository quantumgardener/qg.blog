In July 2024 I ran [[Maxsum Consulting]]'s Tech Tuesday with Maxsum session. The topic was [[Conversational technology]] and the importance of knowing when to have conversations online, and when not to.

The presentation in full runs 45 minutes, and you can find it at [TTwM - July 2024 - Conversational Technology](https://maxsum.wistia.com/medias/nc4v6bev31).
