I first played Elite on my [[Commodore 64]] computer in the mid-80's and then on the [[Commodore Amiga]]. There was something fascinating about the mix of flying in space, battling pirates and trading to improve my equipment. 

When it came out for the [[PlayStation 4]] I was in and soon began playing with a Thrustmaster HOTAS PS4 controller for better ship control. That was literally, as they say, "a game changer". Way better than the similar space trade game I used to play on my iPhone.

The mark of achievement in Elite has always been to achieve an Elite level. I don't know what they were in the old days as I never got close but in this version I have achieved the Elite rank in Exploration and then later in Trade.

Elite is an amazingly complex game with a steep difficulty curve for each new aspect of the game you attempt. But once you get the hang of any particular task it seems easy. Thankfully there are lots and lots of online resources to help (and mates too!).

I'm currently undertaking [[My trip to the other side of the Galaxy]].

[My Elite Dangerous trophies](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/6291-elite-dangerous/Quantum-Gardener) - won't get them all due to multiplayer requirements.

## Moments of note
- Long-haul trip to the centre of the galaxy
