My first virtual reality headset and an experience I enjoyed. Both for [[PlayStation VR2 games]] and 2D games on what appeared like a 100" screen right in front of my eyes.

Since I wear glasses, I ordered prescription lenses from [Hons VR](https://honsvr.com) and could play without fear of my glasses scratching the PSVR2 lens.

But, it made me burpy and uncomfortable enough not to play for extended periods of time. Like anything, it then gets forgotten. I ended up selling the unit to fund my [[Canon R50 Mirrorless|Canon R50]] camera.
