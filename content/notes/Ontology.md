*Ontology* is the branch of [[Metaphysics]] concerned with the study of being, or what it means to be and live as a human. 

It can also refer to a group of terms, concepts and ideas used in a subject area or domain. 

This gives the [[The Ontology of the Human Observer]] a double meaning. The set of concepts that help us understand what it means to be human.
