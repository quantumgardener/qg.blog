title: Let the mental models of the world teach me
---
The world can teach me if I let it. I can take advantage of [[Mental model|Mental models]] if I overcome three flaws[^1]. Each flaw is an [[Enemy of learning]] to be understood.

## Flaw 1: Failure of perspective
My perspective limits comprehension of what is there. I stand inside a problem thinking my position is [[The truth]], acutely undermining any greater understanding. Yet, even the wrong angle from outside the problem is detrimental. I may not even be looking in the correct direction.

[[Mental model|Mental models]] help us look at multiple perspectives.

## Flaw 2: Ego constrains me
I am [[Anxiety|afraid]] what others will think if I put forward ideas they don't agree with. I feel safer keeping quiet rather than risk ridicule.

Or, I may exhibit [[Arrogance]] and overconfidence that I'm correct so refrain from situations where I might be challenged.

As I become comfortable with each of the [[List of mental models]], I can satisfy my ego knowing I am acting smart ðŸ˜‰. Ego can be both an [[Enemy of learning]] and an [[Ally of learning]].

## Flaw 3: Tyranny of distance
[[Concernful activity|I care most about the decisions that directly impact me]]. I naturally care less as the impact moves further away (distance and time) and become lazy in my decision making. At the same time, harder to attain complex ideas (further away and stroking our ego) are prioritised over elementary ideas. 

I risk undue harm to others, and back on myself, when I fail to consider the viewpoints [[Mental model|Mental models]] offer across time and distance.
