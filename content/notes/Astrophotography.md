## Instructional guides
- [Astrophotography 101: A Lesson Series on Photographing the Milky Way – Lonely Speck](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/astrophotography-101/) - large MOC with multiple articles to work through on all topics

# Planning
## Light Pollution
- [Light Pollution Map for Bendigo](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=10.00&lat=-36.7582&lon=144.2802&layers=0BFFFFFTFFFFFFFFFFF) - I have this app on my mobile phone.
- [The Bortle Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_scale) is a measurement of light pollution. My house is Bortle 5, "Suburban"

## Setting Shutter speeds 
[Société Astronomique du Havre - Règle NPF : temps de pose pour éviter le filé d'étoiles](https://web.archive.org/web/20200220123345/https://www.sahavre.fr/tutoriels/astrophoto/34-regle-npf-temps-de-pose-pour-eviter-le-file-d-etoiles)
- View in Chome and translate to English.

[Input-referred Read Noise versus ISO Setting](https://www.photonstophotos.net/Charts/RN_e.htm)
- find a point where it begins to level off
- [[My Photography Gear|Canon 400D]] - needs to be ISO 1600 which is max ISO
- [[Canon R50 Mirrorless]] - ISO 800 but ISO 800 would be fine

## Suitable telescopes
- [[Telescopes I May Want to Buy]]

## Guide scopes
- [Selecting a Guide Scope and Autoguiding Camera for Astrophotography](https://astroforumspace.com/selecting-a-guide-scope-and-autoguiding-camera-for-astrophotography/)

## Astro cameras
- [Best ZWO cameras for planetary imaging and deep-sky (DSO) astrophotography](https://astroforumspace.com/best-zwo-cameras-for-planetary-imaging-and-deep-sky-dso-astrophotography/)

## Lenses
- Characteristics
	- Fast lens f2.8, f2.4, and better if faster again
	- Low aberrations 
	- Bigger lenses need tracker and gets to deep sky
- [[Canon EF 50mm f1.8 STM]]
	- [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Astrophotography Review – Lonely Speck](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/canon-ef-50mm-f1-8-stm-astrophotography-review/)
		- The 50mm focal length is a little narrow for capturing the Milky Way, so the lens’s best use is for capturing narrower crops of detailed sections of the sky, perhaps using multiple frames for producing a [stacked image](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/photographing-and-processing-the-constellation-orion-astrophotography-image-stacking-and-lrgb-processing/) or even a [panorama stitch](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/medium-format-astrophotography-with-panorama-stitching/) for a wide angle field of view.

> [!TIP] For stacked photos
https://photographylife.com/night-sky-image-stacking
Turn off long exposure noise reductions C.FN-2
Turn off image stablisation on the long lens
Set Tungsten white balance
