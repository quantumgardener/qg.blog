[[Quartz/notes/Wonder]] is of the most powerful of the [[Basic moods of life]]. Wonder occurs when we are fully accepting and embracing of the uncertainty that life brings. Each moment offers an opportunity to learn something new about our world and our self. It is expansive yet safe; seemingly a paradox given that wonder is rooted in uncertainty. Those in Wonder are curious of all around them. Wonder is often paired with the mood of [[Gratitude]]. It is the opposite, in a sense, of [[Anxiety]].
