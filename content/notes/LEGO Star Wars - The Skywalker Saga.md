Purchased [[2022-05-07]] with gift vouchers from work. Enjoying the gameplay and jokes but got caught up in a possible [[Platinum trophy]] which made it all about the collectibles. Eventually I decided this wasn't going to be worth my time. Finished playing all the 9 movie storylines on [[2024-11-22.]]

Mostly enjoyable, but the game certainly highlights how bad the last three movies are in comparison to the rest. Lots of filler levels.
