'**Quantum OS** is my operating system which in no way suggests I am a computer. Rather, it is a set of notes that describe the rules and standards I have determined are best to manage my digital information as I see fit. 

> [!INFO] CORE CONCEPT
> [[Organising Digital Knowledge Across Multiple Systems]] describes in detail where I store documents and how I organise them..

## Overarching principles

- I [[Don't Duplicate Public Knowledge]] because it is a waste of my time and yours.
- [[Personal Knowledge Management Systems Must Be Flexible]] otherwise it puts unnecessary friction into thinking.
- [[Designing The Quantum Garden]]
- [[Tags Are Not Knowledge]]
## Managing content
Knowledge and records stored within my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system are subject to the following rules and guidelines.

| I want to...                 | ...manage the Digital Garden                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Attach a file                | [[Photo, image and attachments guidelines]]   |
| Tag a journal entry          | [[Tagging Journal Entries]]                   |
| Add [[Maps of Content]]      | [[Maps of Contents Guidelines]]               |
| Add a source                 | [[Source guidelines]]                         |
| Add a property or tag        | [[Property Guidelines]] \| [[Tag Guidelines]] |
| Check for consistency/errors | [[+Index for QA]]                             |
| Rate an item                 | [[How I Apply Ratings]]                       |
| Specify a heading            | [[Heading Level Guidelines]]                  |
## Selection of Landscapes
There are no hard and fast rules about what [[Landscapes]] are assigned to a note. I try to fit the descriptions as close as I can.

[[productive-laziness|Productive Laziness]] and [[the-garden-shed|The Garden Shed]] are very close to Quantum OS in nature and the difference is subtle. They reflect the general approach and Quantum OS is my specific application. Theory and practice.
