'**Quantum OS** is my operating system which in no way suggests I am a computer. Rather, it is a set of notes that describe the rules and standards I have determined are best to manage my digital information as I see fit. 
## Overarching principles

- I [[Don't Duplicate Public Knowledge]] because it is a waste of my time and yours.
- [[Personal Knowledge Management Systems Must Be Flexible]] otherwise it puts unnecessary friction into thinking.
- [[Designing The Quantum Garden]]

## Selection of Landscapes
There are no hard and fast rules about what [[Landscapes]] are assigned to a note. I try to fit the descriptions as close as I can.

[[productive-laziness|Productive Laziness]] and [[the-garden-shed|The Garden Shed]] are very close to Quantum OS in nature and the difference is subtle. They reflect the general approach and Quantum OS is my specific application. Theory and practice.
