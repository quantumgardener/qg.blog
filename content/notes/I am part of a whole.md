It is so easy to get angry. It is so easy to put oneself above others. It is so easy to forget people are not objects. 

A world of hate and anger is not somewhere I want to live. It is not somewhere I want my wife, daughters, family and friends to live. It is not a world I want for anyone.

Today the world has changed. Fearful of what that might bring I am making a public declaration. 

For the next 4 years and beyond I will strive to be the best I can be. I will continue the journey started this year reading philosophy, and learn from the wisdom of those who have been before me. I will apply that knowledge to living as just one small part of greater whole. My [[Way of Being]] will help and support the people I meet every day to the benefit of us all.
