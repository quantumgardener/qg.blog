The PS3 was a Christmas present in 2007 and although I'd owned both a [[PlayStation 1]] and [[PlayStation 2]], this was the first unit that really felt powerful and many of my most treasured gaming experiences began here.

In total I owned 3 units. The first had a fan die and was replaced under warranty. Then, a month later the Bluetooth chip went in that one and it was replaced as well.
