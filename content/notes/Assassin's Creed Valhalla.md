![[vg_Assassin's Creed Valhalla.webp|media-cover|200]]

Completed the main storyline after almost 2 years since first playing. There was a long break in the middle. Overall I enjoyed the game. Could have done without the Assassin's Creed Animus storyline. It didn't anything to my experience and took up time. By the time I finished I was so overpowered I was invincible. Even the end-game boss battles were trivial. 

I'm unlikely to try for the [[Platinum Trophy]] on this game. I've already put 94.5 hours into it. Would take at least another 60 to get the remaining collectible type trophies and that's not worth such an investment in time.

My experiences playing [[Elden Ring]] transferred over and I was better in my recent second-half playthrough than originally. Who knew blocking attacks was a thing?
