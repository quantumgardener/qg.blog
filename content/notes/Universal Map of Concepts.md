Most of what I think about and enjoy doing can be tied the concepts listed in this [[Universal Map of Concepts]]. Keeping with the metaphor of a [[Digital garden]], the map is organised into several [[Landscapes]] of activity and thinking.

| Landscape                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Expand my Way of Being]] | My [[Way of Being]] is more than the behaviour I show. It’s the total sum of how I engage with the world, make meaning from my environment and take action. Expanding my Way of Being by being a learner in the world creates new possibilities for me to move forward in life. |
| [[Hobby Together]]                 | I’m a gamer, a miniature painter, a role-player, a cross-stitcher and enjoyer of good movies and TV at home.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Productive Laziness]]       | There is art in doing as much as possible, as easily as possible and that’s what I call being **productive lazy**.                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[uses]]                                           | Every garden needs a good shed, full of the right tools to make it flourish. These are the tools I'm using.                                                                                                                                                                     |
