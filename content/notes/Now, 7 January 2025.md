I'm into the final week of leave and am in a good place. I've worked on many things important to me and get some decent progress. 

[[Astro Bot]] was a joy to play and I completed the main story line a couple of days ago. Now on the clean up heading towards the [[Platinum trophy]] trophy. I hope I have the patience to get. Ideally before visiting our daughter a state over so I can loan her the game. Not sure I have the reflexes to do that fast enough.

I've begun reading [[King (1980), Firestarter|Firestarter]] as I continue a read through all of [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] novels. It's clear why many of his movies don't translate so well to the screen. All the detail is in the characters and what they think. Always hard to get across visually.

[My website](https://quantumgardener.info) now has a menu pointing to [[Landscapes]] and key jumping-off pages. A rabbit hole has been opened. The platform I publish with ([[Quartz 4]]) has a slightly different approach for each of the menu, page table of contents, [[Backlink|Backlinks]] list and recent [[blog]] lists. All software can suffer from inconsistencies when care isn't taken to keep modules consistent. I understand. It takes work. Though I'm [[Gratitude|Grateful]] for the community involvement and development, I will have to branch off my own code. Something simple that can be built up. The current components are tripping each other up with their ability to hide. I want visitors to have a better experience on my site.

I photographed some of my [[Warhammer]] miniatures this morning. I'm super happy with the results and it was a chance to put some more time into [[100 hours learning Affinity Photo]]. The camera battery died so I shall return to the task.
