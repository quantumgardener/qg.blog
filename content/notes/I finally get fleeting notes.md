title: I finally get fleeting notes
---
I spend more time than most on creating small systems to support my work and creativity. My systems develop and improve over time (some even become redundant) and I have a good sense of when and how to much to improve them. I have learned to listen to my systems.

Last Friday I was converting book notes from my [[Kindle Scribe]] when I heard loud and clear the indication I was wasting my time and change was needed. [[Zettelkasten]] is a note-taking method with many variations and interpretations on how to proceed. I thought I had it "correct" until realising I'd wasted the last half hour of my life. I'll argue now it wasn't a true waste because what I learned from that time will save me time in the future, letting me become more [[Productive Laziness|Productively lazy]].

My process was:
1. Highlight and take handwritten notes on my [[Kindle Scribe]].
2. Export the notes to PDF (sent to from the Kindle to my email account).
3. Transfer the book notes (a.k.a. [[Fleeting note|Fleeting notes]]) into the book page I'd created in [[Obsidian]]. For every note in the PDF version,
	1. Create a heading for the location or page number reference
	2. Copy and paste the highlighted text
	3. Type my handwritten notes[^1]
4. Revisit each of the [[Fleeting note|Fleeting notes]] and integrate them into the broader note base as [[Permanent note|Permanent notes]] (also considered by many to be [[Literature note|Literature notes]] because a piece of literature is the source).

Step 3 took 90 minutes of focussed work, and it was only half of the notes I'd taken. My understanding of how my reading notes integrate into [[Permanent note|Permanent notes]] grew as I worked. I regularly found myself mentally adding to existing notes. Eventually I realised the copying of notes from PDF didn't add any value as once integrated I would have no need for the [[Fleeting note|Fleeting notes]][^2]. Why was I not working directly from the original PDF?

Today I changed my approach for the first round of notes from [[Parrish (2024), The Great Mental Models (General Thinking Concepts)|The Great Mental Models (General Thinking Concepts)]]. I eliminated completely step 3 and instead of working from a copy in [[Obsidian]], I created notes directly from the exported PDF. I'm glad I didn't pre-copy everything as some of the [[Fleeting note|Fleeting notes]] weren't even required.

Listening to my systems early in their life when I'm actively learning helps me improve them intuitively and quickly. My systems evolve alongside my changing needs.

[^1]: I ended up taking a screen grab of the longer notes and asking [[Copilot for Microsoft 365]] to convert to text which I then copied and pasted.
