[what3words](https://what3words.com) are dropping from the free API the ability to convert coordinates from GPS to what3words syntax.

I use it for a few [[IMatch to Socials|photos automatically shared]] on [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.au/@dcbuchan) to provide location information. It's too expensive for the very few times I use it to continue. Â£7.99/month.

I'm left wondering if it's a quick way to kill of a platform that should have had better take up in the first place. The idea is wonderful. Describe any 3m<sup>2</sup> square on Earth with a unique combination of three words.
