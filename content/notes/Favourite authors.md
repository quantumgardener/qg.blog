The authors on this list are those whose books I come back to time and again. You can pretty much guarantee that if a new title is published, I'll be reading it.

- [[Brandon Sanderson]] - a fantasy powerhouse
- [[Stephen King]]
- [[Mark Lawrence]]
- **Tom Morris** - Modern day philosopher. Every time I've been successful Tom's *7 C's of Success* have all been in play.
- **John Maxwell** - Leadership mentor. An amazing knack (though hard work no doubt) of distilling leadership lessons into understandable pieces.
- **Alan Sieler** - Ontological coach. My coaching mentor and author of two excellent books on the method of Ontological Coaching.
- [[Tad Williams]]
