A couple of days ago, my daughter asked in all seriousness if I spent all day in meetings, or did I get a chance to do some actual work. She'd been in a 1.5hr meeting planning some activities for her university course.

It led me to think:

- **What meetings should be** — conversations where we share information in order to [[Conversation for coordination of action|coordinate action]], [[Conversation for clarity|get aligned]], and [[Conversation for stories and personal assessments|connect at a personal level]].
- **What meetings too often are** — opportunities to force opinions in order to coerce others.
