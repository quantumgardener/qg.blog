There are as many systems to apply ratings as there are things which can be rated.

> [!INFO] Ratings are applied as keywords beginning with `#rating/`

This [[Digital garden]] uses a 5-star scale applied as follows: 

[[5-star|⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️]] — Life defining. Part of my identity. [[4-star|⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️]]

[[4-star|⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️]] — I am certain to recommend this enthusiastically to people I think would be interested. More than happy to watch it again. Very likely to buy the movie if I've seen it in the cinema.

[[3-star|⭐️⭐️⭐️]] — Run of the mill good. Enjoyed it

[[2-star|⭐️⭐️]] — Meh. Not great. The type of movie or book I finished but can't be sure really why I bothered.

[[1-star|⭐️]] — Never again! I didn't enjoy it, I don't like it, and I want that time of my life back.
