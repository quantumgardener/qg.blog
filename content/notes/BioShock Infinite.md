This is the first Bioshock game that I played and only because it was a free monthly game on the [[PlayStation 3]].

I enjoyed the art style and game play enough to try the original BioShock which I didn't enjoy much at all. I think I have all three games as free games now so I might return to it one day. Might.

There is a twist in the game at the end. It makes the story great and is the source of a great story. A female gaming journalist was in a coffee shop wearing a BioShock Infinite t-shirt. Some total idiot male had a go at her about "Probably not even played it" so she told him the ending[^1]. Unacceptable behaviour that got everything it deserved.
