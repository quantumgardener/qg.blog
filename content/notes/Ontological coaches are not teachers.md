The role of an [[Ontological coach]] is to engage a coachee in a conversation that produces relevant, practical and powerful [[Ontological learning]] for the coachee. Though they may provide what appear to be tools and techniques, these are always set against the coachee's own learning about their personal [[Way of Being]].
