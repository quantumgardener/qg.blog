[Wallabag](https://app.wallabag.it) is a read-later service which can also be locally-hosted. Web articles saved to [[Wallabag]] are stripped down to their bare text and image essentials. Notes and tags can then be added for organisation.

I use the [[obsidian-wallabag (plugin)]] to download archived articles directly into my [[Digital garden]] where I then integrate them with my other notes.
