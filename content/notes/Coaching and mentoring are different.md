A mentor takes their experience and uses it to direct and steer a mentee with less experience. Typically, the mentee wants to reach the same life situation as their mentor. The primary focus of a mentoring conversation is, "Follow my example," and the primary mood is [[Arrogance]]. [[Having a negative mentor is as valuable as a positive mentor]].

Conversely, a coach uses their knowledge of a domain, and often through experience, to help a coachee observe differently and see where they can progress. The primary focus of a coaching conversation is, "Here, let me help you find your own way," and the primary mood is [[Humility]].

To external ears, the words of each conversation may sound similar.
