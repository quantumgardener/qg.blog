> [!INFO] Within a note, headings start at Heading 2. 

This is because, when displaying notes using [[Quartz 4]], the title of the note is set to Heading 1 and to have a second Heading 1 breaks the structure of the document.

Use CSS styling to distinguish headings from the displayed Title of a document.
