I have a relatively new car. It’s done just over 3,000km. Here is a crazy coincidence from earlier today.

- The odometer read 3,000km while I was stopped at traffic lights.
- The odometer read 2,000km while I was stopped at traffic lights. There are not so many traffic lights where I live that this would be at all likely.
- The two sets of traffic lights were less that 3km apart.
- Both readings were after I had been away at a client, on a 500km+ round trip. The route taken each time, completely different.  

I’m loving the feeling of wonder I am experiencing at all that.
