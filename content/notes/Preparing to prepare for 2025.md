Four more days of work until my Christmas break. I then have 24 days to decide what 2025 and beyond looks like. Normally approaching Christmas I'm an hot mess of total mental wastage and thanks to only working 4-days/week since July I'm in a significantly improved state.

I've been mentally preparing, and even making some brief notes, on the areas I'll tend to next year. I'm ready to start wintering[^1].
## The big question
Front and foremost is the question of how I integrate my role as an IT Strategy Consultant with my personal goals of writing about [[Way of Being]] and all that entails. I don't have a clear description of where I want to travel and I need one if I'm to prevent splitting into incompatible, or even competing, tracks. 

[[Proprioceptive writing]] will help me get the clarity I need and this week I must commit a practise schedule for the holiday and hit at least a definition early.

I'm sure there will be a [[Blogging]] target as well. Probably a mix of ad-hoc personal blogging, and more purposeful knowledge writing. I have improved my writing across the last few months and look forward to further development in that area.
## Hobby related
There has to be some rationalisation of my hobbies. Too much is left undone and that plays on my mind. Here I have to tread a fine line between committing to finish everything, not leaving time for work coming from "The big question" and failing to leave time for hobbies to do what they do bestâ€”provide downtime.

I'm certain I'll follow the [Nerdforge](https://www.youtube.com/@Nerdforge) model of placing 100 dedicated hours into learning a skill[^2][^3][^4] and put 100 hours into learning photo editing techniques in [[Affinity Photo 2]]. 

I would also like to complete [[Danish ships cross-stitch]] and painting my [[Sylvaneth Treelord Ancient]]

## Health related
I've joined a local gym. Still to have my first session. My commitment is to attend every Friday with the goal of firstly building up my strength.

I may offer to cook Friday night's, but that's a bit scary.

## Reading and TV and movies and gaming
Plenty of "professional reading". I'd like to finish [[Plato, Cooper (1977) -- Plato - Complete Works]] and more of the Complete History of Philosophy series.

I'm trying to finish TV series before starting another and I have a few movies to catch up on as well. Most likely I'll get to them in the holidays.

Hoping for [[Astrobot]] for Christmas.
