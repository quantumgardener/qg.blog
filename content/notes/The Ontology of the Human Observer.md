[[Ontology]] is the study of being and *The Ontology of the Human Observer* is a study into what it means to be human through understanding how we combine perception, communication and behaviour[^1] as our [[Way of Being]].

*The Ontology of the Human Observer* is a relatively new discipline which is firmly and rigorously grounded. It was founded by [[Fernando Flores]] based on his observations and after meeting with [[Humberto Maturana]]. The discipline was extended primarily into the domains of emotion and body by [[Julio Olalla]] and [[Rafael Echeverria]]. The term [[The Ontology of the Human Observer]] was coined by [[Alan Sieler]].
