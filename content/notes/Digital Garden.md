A **digital garden** is a form of website where the author creates and curates ideas in public. 

As they collect information and write, notes are published in various stages of completeness (tagged [[seedling]], [[budding]] or [[evergreen]]) so that others can benefit from what's there and then, without the burden of having to finish an article. 

This allows the author to continue writing and tending to other areas of the garden, perhaps before they have finished with the first garden bed.

You're in a digital garden right now.
