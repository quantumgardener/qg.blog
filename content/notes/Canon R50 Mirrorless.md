> [!INFO] Santa brought me a [Canon R50](https://www.canon.com.au/cameras/eos-r50) camera for Christmas in 2023. It's a noticeable improvement on the [[Canon 400D DSLR|Canon 400D]] for [[Photography]].

Compared to the 400D, this camera gives me:
- Live view on the back screen
- More focusing points
- +/- 3 stops of exposure bracketing instead of +/- 2
- ISO significantly greater than 1600
- Lighter body
- 4K video recording
- More pixels of the mega kind
- Interface and technology that is 17 years further forward
- Hi-res viewfinder

| Sensor Size | Resolution  | Pixel Pitch[^1] |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------------- |
| APS-C       | 6000 x 4000 | 5.34 Âµm         |
## Lenses
Refer [[My Camera Lenses]] for a list of the lenses I have available to me. The EF lenses attach using the base Canon EF-EFS/RF adaptor.
## Battery
The battery is model LP-E17.
