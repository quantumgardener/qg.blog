Within a [[digital garden]] it's very easy to get caught in the trap of duplicating public knowledge that can be found elsewhere, or is otherwise known.

For example, *The Lord of the Rings* is made up of *[[Fellowship of the Ring]]*, *[[The Two Towers]]* and *[[The Return of the King]]*. There is no benefit in me re-creating that structure here.

That [[Andy Serkis]] starred in the Lord of the Rings movies, and [[The Batham]] likewise doesn't need a mention here.

Another example, I know that my purhcase of [[LEGO Star Wars - The Skywalker Saga]] is for both that [[PlayStation 4]] and the [[PlayStation 5]], but you'll only see it tagged `#game/video-game/playstation-5` because that's the platform I played it on.

Recreating public knowledge wastes time and has a lot of overhead to manage; time better spent elsewhere.
