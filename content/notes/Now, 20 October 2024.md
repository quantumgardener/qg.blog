The end of 2024 is fast approaching. I will be taking 3 week's leave to recuperate. Last year I ran out of work and added two days extra up-front because I had no work to do. I'll stay until the end of the scheduled work time this December.

Spring growth can be annoying. It has been two weekends of weeding and mowing. I have a butane weed-burner now. It works, but needs a bigger blowtorch head to kill and obliterate the weeds in one go. Mine is narrow and under-powered for established weeds.

My read book count has jumped with a few shorter books. *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius, *On Writing* by Stephen King, and *The Element of Style* by William Strunk and E.B. White. I'm thinking about my writing differently after reading the last two; deliberately selected for that purpose.
