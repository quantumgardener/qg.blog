Monday will be the first King's Birthday public holiday. It's not feeling like a typical long weekend for me. Maybe I've had too many public holidays and they are all the same. That got me thinking...

From the start of my professional working career up until 2013, I had 10 public holidays a year. From 2014, that increased to 11.

Take 52 weeks in a year, less 4 weeks leave, gives 48 weeks. Multiply that by 5 days and you get 240 working days in a year (excluding public holidays).

Which all means that in mid-2019, I exceeded that number in public holidays taken. In other words, I've taken off work a full working year and then some.

Sure doesn't feel like a year off.
