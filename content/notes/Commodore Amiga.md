During my time at University, I owned a [[Commodore Amiga]]. I can't remember exactly where I got the money (may have been work selling the family [[Commodore 64]] which for all intents and purposes was practically mine).

I had an Amiga 1000 which was much more exciting than the later Amiga 500.

At some point I wanted to get chips upgraded and put some more money into a program that was going to do that, but it never eventuated. I did get my money back.

One of the coolest things was the original developers has their signatures printed inside the case.

At a later date I upgraded to an Amiga 2000. Mum drove me down to [[Geelong]] one afternoon to pick it up.

I can't remember any of the [[Quartz/maps/Commodore Amiga games]] that I played on it. Most would have been variants of the [[Quartz/maps/Commodore 64 games]] if anything.
