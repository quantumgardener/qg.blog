During my time at University, I owned a Commodore Amiga. I can't remember exactly where I got the money (may have been selling the family [[Commodore 64]]). Mum drove me down to [[Geelong]] one afternoon to pick it up.

I had an Amiga 1000 which was much more exciting than the later Amiga 500.

At some point I wanted to get chips upgraded and put some more money into a program that was going to do that, but it never eventuated. I did get my money back.

One of the coolest things was the original developers has their signatures printed inside the case.

At a later date I upgraded to an Amiga 2000.
