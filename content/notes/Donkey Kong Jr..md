![[vg_Donkey Kong Jr.webp|media-cover]]

This has to go down as my first computer game. A perfect Christmas present when [[Nintendo Game and Watch|Nintendo Game & Watch]] devices were all the rage. My brothers got a game as well. I always thought mine was the best (as I'm sure each of us did). 

At 999 points the game started again, but faster. This was called "clocking it". My best was to clock it 3 times in the one game. By then it was super fast and I was fully in the zone.

*Colour graphics! This format took the world by storm and rightly so.*
