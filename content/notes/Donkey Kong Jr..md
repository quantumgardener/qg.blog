![[vg_Donkey Kong Jr.webp|200]]

This has to go down as my first computer game. A perfect Christmas present when Game and Watch devices were all the rage. [[Craig Buchan|Craig]] and [[Jamie Buchan|Jamie]] got a game as well. I always thought mine was the best.

At 999 points the game started again, but faster. This was called "clocking it". My best was to clock it 3 times in the one game. By then it was super fast.
