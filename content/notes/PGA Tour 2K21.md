![[vg_PGA Tour 2K21.webp|media-cover|200]]

I hadn't played any sort of golf game since the [[Commodore 64]] days, so this free game from Sony in 2021 was great and I really enjoyed it. Mostly I played on beginner and by the end of the PGA tour was regularly scoring 16-18 under par on a round.

Twice a hole in one! Never managed an albatross though I came close may times.
