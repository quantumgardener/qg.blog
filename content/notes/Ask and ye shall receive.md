In my [[How to identify lifes breakdowns|last post]] I wrote about the notion of breakdowns and how a breakdown between what we expect and what happens can cause suffering. Today I want to touch briefly on a powerful way forward which is often overlooked.

If you need help, ask for it. Make the [[Request]].

So simple and yet time and again I've evidenced people slogging away trying to solve their problems alone when all they have to do is ask. There are many reasons why they don't. Pride, insecurity and stubborness are just three reasons. The biggest is habit. They are not in the habit of asking for assistance. They are in the habit of not asking.

For the rest of today and tomorrow note to yourself how often you think about asking for assistance and then don't (or if offered turn it down). How strong is your habit?
