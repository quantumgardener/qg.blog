title: 100 hours learning Affinity Photo
---
A goal of 2025 is to spend 100 hours learning how to edit photos in [[Affinity Photo]]. 

Time spent to date: 2.0 hrs

## 7 January 2025
Some simple editing today as I managed to get the exposure out of the camera mostly perfect and I was working photos taken with my [[Canon R50 Mirrorless|Canon R50]]. Still, it was a chance to become more familiar with the [[Huion HS610 Creative Pen Tablet]]. It is already very comfortable and fast to work with. I find it more natural than the mouse.

I had two goals for today. Learn how to use the [[Huion HS610 Creative Pen Tablet]] and masking. The image below is of [[Windsor Castle]] taken on [[1999-10-23|23 October 1999]] and taken from a scanned print. I am happy with the masking of the watch tower and small concrete well below it making it both darker and like a bad special effect. It's too sharp on the top edge. I used a selection tool with refinements for the tower, and the brush tool to add the path below it. The sky has been made blue using a luminosity mask. I can't tell you how I managed it. Trial and error on the sliders. The tablet was more intuitive today.
