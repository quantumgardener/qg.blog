Brewing THE BEST cup of tea ever require you to:

1. Boil water
2. Pour water over tea (tea bag, strainer or tea pot)
3. Let the tea steep for as long as you want
4. Add milk and sugar to taste

That's it. Sorry if you were expecting a long discourse on the exact water temperature to use, the amount of tea leaves, the volume of the tea pot, or anything part of the tea making process.

TikTok, Instagram and YouTube promise the best way or the top 5 ways to do something that is ultimately personal taste. Nobody can tell you how to brew the best cup of tea (or coffee) for you. At best they can share what works for them.

I change throughout the day. My mood changes, my body changes, the time and situation I'm in changes. Yes, I prefer my tea strong and with milk, no sugar, but if I have to make do I will. Perfect is measured in the moment.

In the spirit of sharing, here is what works for me.

1. Make a cup of tea.
2. Close my eyes, pause to shut out the world, and take a sip.
