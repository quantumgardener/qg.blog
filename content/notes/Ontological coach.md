An [[Ontological coach]] is someone who is trained in using the [[The Ontology of the Human Observer]] during a coaching conversation as a way to help a coachee understanding their [[Way of Being]]. 

They are trained to acutely and astutely observer across [[The three ontological domains]] and the more observant they are, the more they can bring to an [[Ontological coaching]] conversation[^1].

[[Ontological coaches are not teachers]] and help coachees with their own discovery and learning[^1] rather than provide tools and tips for behavioural change.
