**Quantum OS** is my operating system which in no way suggests I am a computer. Rather, it is a set of notes that describe the rules and standards I have determined are best to manage my digital information as I see fit. 

## Overarching principles
I [[Don't Duplicate Public Knowledge]] because it is a waste of my time.

## Managing content
| I want to...                 | ...manage the Digital Garden                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Attach a file                | [[Photo, image and attachments guidelines]] |
| Tag a journal entry          | [[Journal tags]]                            |
| Add [[Maps of Content]]      | [[Maps of Contents guidelines]]             |
| Create section intro         | [[Section intros]]                          |
| Add a source                 | [[Source guidelines]]                       |
| Add a tag                    | [[Tag guidelines]]                          |
| Check for consistency/errors | [[+Index for QA]]                           |
| Index some content           | [[Index guidelines]]                        |
| Rate an item                 | [[How I Apply Ratings]]                 |
| Understand backups                             |   [[My Backup Strategy]]                                          |

## Selection of Landscapes
There are no hard and fast rules about what [[Landscapes]] are assigned to a note. I try to fit the descriptions as close as I can.

[[productive-laziness|Productive Laziness]] and [[the-garden-shed|The Garden Shed]] are very close to Quantum OS in nature and the difference is subtle. They reflect the general approach and Quantum OS is my specific application. Theory and practice.
