title: Quantum OS
description: This is my operating system which in no way suggests I am a computer. Rather, it is a set of notes that describe the rules and standards I have determined are best to manage my digital information as I see fit.

**Quantum OS** is what I call the underlying organisation and structural rules underpinning this [[digital garden]] and non-online notes.
