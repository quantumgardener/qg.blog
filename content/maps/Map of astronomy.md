There are two aspects to my astronomy hobbying. Direct visual observation using my [[Celestron SkyMaster 20x80 Binoculars]] and [[Astrophotography]].

These are a couple of ways astronomy gives me a deep sense of wonder.
- Remember when looking at the stars, [[We are all stardust]].
- There is always [[A distant past in my backyard]].
