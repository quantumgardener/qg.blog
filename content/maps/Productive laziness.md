There is art in doing as much as possible, as easily as possible and that’s what I call being **productive lazy**.

It’s a balance between maximising productivity with as little effort as possible and applies particularly to repetitive tasks where I want them done quickly and without having to think too much. There is too much going on in my world to allow thinking where I don’t need to.

To understand what this means look at [[Some examples of productive laziness]] to begin. Whilst they are practical, it's the mindset between them that is most important.

## Writing and Content Management
- [[Backlinks are important]] in helping people find relationships between content that my not have been explicitly identified up front, but which evolve over time as more *relatable content* is created.
- Anyone wanting to develop their *Productive laziness* must be aware that [[Interrupting the flow of work has a tax]]. Much of what we are doing is reducing the impact of this tax.
