To understand what this means look at [[Some examples of productive laziness]] to begin. Whilst they are practical, it's the mindset between them that is most important.

The [[Promise Cycle]] is a model for understanding how people come together to complete work. Knowing about it can help avoid problems before they arise. The same model is used for [[Delegation]].

[[Time Management]] is the process of managing one's time. It is a limited resource, as is the time of others. Therefore time management is essential in treating people as a [[Legitimate other]]. Something that makes [[Time Management]] easier is a strong practice of [[Personal knowledge management]].

[[Wonder]] is my favourite of the [[Basic moods of life]] and to access wonder, I use [[Meditation activities I get lost in]], [[Map of astronomy|Astronomy]] and [[Mathematics]].

A [[Mood]] predisposes me to act in a particular ways which includes my thinking. The orientation of the mood (positive or negative) will expand or constrict my [[Thought horizon]]. Moods can therefore also be useful in [[Expanding my comfort zone]].

Life is not black and white. A significant amount of time is spent dealing with [[Wicked problem|Wicked problems]]. Ways to deal with these include understanding [[The Difference Between Assessments and Assertions]] and conversation support tools like [[Dialogue Mapping]] or [[Systems Thinking]].

[[It's OK to slow down]]. Something as simple as the [[2-Minute Rule]] can create space to think clearly, or get in touch with your current [[Emotions|Emotions]]. Slowing down also creates space for [[Listening]] and [[Considered Conversation]].

[[Debugging is a life skill]] and not a software development process. It requires setting aside what you know and working a process of inquiry and [[Listening]]. The skill is not jumping to conclusions about the answer and taking your questioning one step at a time.

[[Meditation activities I get lost in]] is important and exists beyond the trope of sitting with your legs crossed and chanting. Meditation is only one of many ways to achieve [[Mindfulness]]. Others include [[Cross-stitch]], [[Computer Gaming]], [[Miniature Painting]] and washing the dishes.

## Writing and Content Management
- [[Backlinks are important]] in helping people find relationships between content that my not have been explicitly identified up front, but which evolve over time as more *relatable content* is created.
- Anyone wanting to develop their *Productive laziness* must be aware that [[Interrupting the flow of work has a tax]]. Much of what we are doing is reducing the impact of this tax.
- [[Mastering the chaos of source notes]] is something to be aware of lest you end up with piles of unused inputs. Be careful of [[The optimisation-procrastination trap]].
