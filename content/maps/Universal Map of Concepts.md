Most of what I think about and enjoy doing can be tied the concepts listed in this [[Universal Map of Concepts]]. Keeping with the metaphor of a [[Digital garden]], the map is organised into five [[Landscapes]] of activity and thinking.
## Expanding my Way of Being

> My [[Way of Being]] is more than the behaviour I show. It’s the total sum of how I engage with the world, make meaning from my environment and take action. Expanding my Way of Being by being a learner in the world creates new possibilities for me to move forward in life.

[[Ontology]] is both the study of being and the concepts and ideas in a field of study. I use [[The Ontology of the Human Observer]] extensively as a framework for my understanding of how interact with the world.

[[Ontological coaching]] helps people with their [[Ontological learning]] by giving them a set of [[Distinction|Distinctions]] that provide them with insight into their current [[Way of Being]] and create the potential for an [[Ontological shift]]

My personal experience of my [[Way of Being]] is a valuable source of learning for me.

Conversation is a fundamental part of human existence. The [[Types of conversation]] we have, the calibre of those conversations, and any [[Missing Conversations]] has a significant impact on the quality of our lives. Our adeptness at [[Conversational Technology]] such as [[Basic Linguistic Acts]] and the [[Promise Cycle]] sits within our [[Way of Being]].

[[Coaching and mentoring are different]]. The focus of a coach is to help a coachee observe their [[Way of Being]] and make adjustments that benefit them. Mentors tend to drop their experience on others as the right and only way to do things. With this approach, a mentor has fallen into the trap of [[Arrogance]].
## Productive laziness

> There is art in doing as much as possible, as easily as possible and that’s what I call being productive lazy. It’s the term I use to describe my approach of doing as much as possible with as little effort as possible and applies particularly to repetitive tasks where I want them done quickly and without having to think too much. There is too much going on in my world to allow thinking where I don’t need to.

The [[Promise Cycle]] is a model for understanding how people come together to complete work. Knowing about it can help avoid problems before they arise. The same model is used for [[Delegation]].

[[Time Management]] is the process of managing one's time. It is a limited resource, as is the time of others. Therefore time management is essential in treating people as a [[Legitimate other]]. Something that makes [[Time Management]] easier is a strong practice of [[Personal knowledge management]].

[[Wonder]] is my favourite of the [[Basic moods of life]] and to access wonder, I use [[Meditation]], [[Map of astronomy|Astronomy]] and [[Mathematics]].

A [[Mood]] predisposes me to act in a particular ways which includes my thinking. The orientation of the mood (positive or negative) will expand or constrict my [[Thought horizon]]. Moods can therefore also be useful in [[Expanding my comfort zone]].

Life is not black and white. A significant amount of time is spent dealing with [[Wicked problem|Wicked problems]]. Ways to deal with these include understanding [[The Difference Between Assessments and Assertions]] and conversation support tools like [[Dialogue Mapping]] or [[Systems Thinking]].

[[It's OK to slow down]]. Something as simple as the [[2-Minute Rule]] can create space to think clearly, or get in touch with your current [[Emotions MOC|Emotions]]. Slowing down also creates space for [[Listening]] and [[Considered Conversation]].

[[Debugging is a life skill]] and not a software development process. It requires setting aside what you know and working a process of inquiry and [[Listening]]. The skill is not jumping to conclusions about the answer and taking your questioning one step at a time.

[[Meditation]] is important and exists beyond the trope of sitting with your legs crossed and chanting. Meditation is only one of many ways to achieve [[Mindfulness]]. Others include [[Cross-stitch]], [[Computer Gaming]], [[Miniature Painting]] and washing the dishes.
## Hobby Together

> I’m a gamer, a miniature painter, a role-player, a cross-stitcher and enjoyer of good movies and TV at home. Here’s where I share my progress on whatever project currently takes my fancy, plus any relevant discussion on supporting technologies.

The focus of my hobbies at any point in time varies. At the moment I have keen interest in [[Photography]] with some [[Astrophotography]] attached.

There is plenty to see in my [[Map of video gaming]] which links out to all the games I've played one the gaming systems I've owned. Sometimes I also paint miniatures like I did when [[Painting Nagash]].

When I can afford it, I might also play with [[LEGO]].
## The Garden Shed
> Every garden needs a good shed, full of the right tools to make it flourish.
## Quantum OS

> My operating system which in no way suggests I am a computer. Rather, it is a set of notes that describe the rules and standards I have determined are best to manage my digital information as I see fit.
