There is art in doing as much as possible, as easily as possible and that’s what I call being productive lazy.

It’s a balance between maximising productivity with as little effort as possible and applies particularly to repetitive tasks where I want them done quickly and without having to think too much. There is too much going on in my world to allow thinking where I don’t need to.
