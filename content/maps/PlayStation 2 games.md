Games that I played on the for the [[PlayStation 2]] console. In the early days games were expensive compared to my disposable income and it had to be pretty special for me to sink dollars into it. This is not a long list. I feel there should have been more but I've been through the complete lists on Wikipedia and these are all that I can remember owning from my time with the console.
