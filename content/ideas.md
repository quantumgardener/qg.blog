description: A (long) list of ideas I may write about.
---
I generate ideas for writing all the time. Here's the list of what I might write about. Many exist in [[Fleeting note]] format.

- Final post in home networking series
- We are biased in our questions eg psychologist and children
- are you bilingual at work. can you translate ideas across domains and people?
- what being a scholar of life means
- Memories of primary school - do you remember events or people
- What you can learn from doing handyman stuff outside using front lights as an example and how I'm controlling your temper is very good before you break things are in yourself or enjoy yourself enjoy hurt  [[Emotion]]
- Forward thinkers and backward thinkers 
    - A past manager's insistence we can't move forward on things eg. Could do it via Zoom, but need to be in person
- Managing dates on computers, GMT/UTC 
- Expand your [[comfort zone]] instead of expanding it 
- What have I got from [[My mediation practice]]
- There is a difference between people telling you to listen to a podcast/book/movie whatever [[Declaration]] and recommending one [[offer]].
    - Idea came to mind listening to [[Frank Skinner]]'s poetry podcast which was mentioned in passing
- We need to have external inputs into our lives - which has been lacking during covid-19. External ideas from conversations with people or through books and podcasts provide new ways to understand our world and generate ideas 
- I will never reach my potential. Each time I learn something and get a step closer my potential moves forward as well. Doesn't stop me from trying. Is this my [[Thought horizon]]? Darkness of thought is a sign something else needs to be learned - but what? Learning anything in the domain helps. Ref Gaming Teaches, [[No Man's Sky]] option below.
- Go too fast and you're burn out. Similar to taking a corner too fast. You may break hard but if you don't get it right lose control as you accelerate out. Here's how to have a good break/vacation, or better still, now not to drive too fast in the first place         
- What's on my home screen - my fav apps and why they are there. Need a page for each. Broadens [[Software that I use]] into platforms. The value may not be in the applications themselves, but in how I connect them, or have relied on them for a long time. Can I create a template of points to cover?
- Cutting out the DOC papers from [[Personal knowledge management]] 
	- Have I actually deleted them?
- When someone asks you for help, instead of raising a ticket, and you respond, it creates a promise you may not be ready to manage .eg clients asking me for stuff they should raise a ticket for
- People who ignore the question "Why?" and how they can skirt around it
	- Don't want to admit they don't know
	- Have a solution in mind and won't let you delve into the idea
- I don't spend enough time defining my work as it comes in
- [[Getting Things Done with Obsidian]] - needs a review and update
- [[Dolby Vision Takes Some Work But is Worth it]] - can I find a date for this? Need to review and update
- What [[Gaming Teaches]]
	- Racing
		- you can push yourself harder than you think
	- [[Elden Ring]]
		- Go slow to go fast. Let yourself die to learn how to play the game better. Don't worry about lost coin. You'll get it back in spades in the long term
	- It's ok to quit. Eg [[Baldur's Gate 3]], refer then to [[Gaming pile of shame]] and linguistic deconstruction of [[Shame]].
	- An approach to learning eg. [[No Man's Sky]], and constant reference to videos on YouTube. How do you split the good from the bad. Same with [[Elite - Dangerous|Elite: Dangerous]]
- My experience of letting go of responsibility
- There is an issue of a asking b to ask you to do something. Always diluted. Never satisfying for anyone. (And it happened again just as I took this note ma book control map meeting). Is there a tie back to old primary school/high school romances of asking people for "dates" via intermediaries?
- "I'm no good at computers and other lies we tell ourselves" (see [[I'm no good at computers]]
- Replacing the light in the loungeroom and having trouble because I was not setting it up with my phone on the IoT network speaks to how easy it is to forget something that we don't do that often. What is the wider lesson?
- Can I learn from making a list of failures? [[Henderson (2024), It is good to be a failure]]
