*quantumgardener.info* is cookie and tracker free.

However, I may change this in the future and have considered using the [Plausible Analytics platform](https://plausible.io) as this would allow me to get useful analytics on which pages are being visited *without capturing any identifiable information about the visitor*[^1].

If I do make a change to begin using Plausible, it will be posted on this site's blog feed. You can subscribe at https://quantumgardener.info/feed/.
