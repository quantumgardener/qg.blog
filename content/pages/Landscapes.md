Standing on the edge of the garden you can see several intriguing landscapes spread out in front of you. Where shall we head?

[[expand-your-way-of-being|Expand Your Way of Being]] — Your Way of Being is more than the behaviour you show. It’s the total sum of how you engage with the world, make meaning from your environment and take action. Expanding your Way of Being creates new possibilities.

[[hobby-together|Hobby Together]] — I’m a gamer, a miniature painter, a role-player, a cross-stitcher and enjoyer of good movies and TV at home. Here’s where I share my progress on whatever project currently takes my fancy, plus any relevant discussion on supporting technologies.

[[productive-laziness|Productive Laziness]] — There is art in doing as much as possible, as easily as possible and that’s what I call being productive lazy. It’s the term I use to describe my approach of doing as much as possible with as little effort as possible and applies particularly to repetitive tasks where I want them done quickly and without having to think too much. There is too much going on in my world to allow thinking where I don’t need to.

[[digital-gardening|Digital Gardening]] — Seed and cultivate thoughts and ideas in public so that others can benefit from what’s there right then. You’re in a digital garden right now.

[[the-garden-shed|The Garden Shed]] — Every garden needs a good shed, full of the right tools to make it flourish.
