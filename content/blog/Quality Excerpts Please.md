Continuing [[Full Text Please|the call for full text feeds]], if you don't wish to do so, please create quality excerpts rather than something automatically created by your blogging system. This will help readers understand what you are speaking about quicker.

Movabletype provides a box for you to write a quality excerpt. Any text you put in there is used as the excerpt for the entry in RSS feeds and elsewhere. If you don't provide something specific, Movabletype defaults to the first 40 characters of your post.
