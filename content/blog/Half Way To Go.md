Each time I hear the Sun is 50% through its life and only has 5 billion years to go, I feel sad.

If we’re not off Earth and into the Milky Way Galaxy by then it’s all over. Colonising the Solar System is not enough.

For humanity it’s less time than 5 billion years. [The Future of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth), gives us a billion years to get the job done at best before the Sun has expanded its influence and engulfs us. Weirdly, that doesn’t feel like it’s long enough. I’ll never see it but I can wonder.
