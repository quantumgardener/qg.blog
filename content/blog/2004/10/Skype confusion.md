I was on a [Skype](http://skype.com) call with [Terry Frazier](http://www.terryfrazier.com) yesterday and everything was going well until I sent him an email with a file attachment. From that point on there was about a 30 second problem with our call. Everything one of us said was heard 30 seconds later by the other. But Skype kept transmitting in the interim and so we were able to talk over each other. The natural flow of conversation meant Terry was responding to points I made 30 second earlier, yet I was hearing his oddly appropriate response to something I'd only just said.
The file simply inserted itself into the communication stream and the negative effects were never recovered. I noted later there is a file send tool within Skype. Maybe it handles the interruption better by splicing the words and file together.
