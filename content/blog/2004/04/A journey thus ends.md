This will be my last post to [[Thought Horizon (Business)|thought?horizon]]

Time and I have both moved on and the purpose driving this weblog is no longer relevant in my daily life. Therefore it is with some sadness but little regret that I acknowledge it is time to formally lay my contributions to the world of knowledge management to rest.

I would like to sincerely thank those of you who took the time to share my thoughts buy subscribing to the site and making comment. It was always the greatest buzz to hear I'd been quoted somewhere and to know that from my humble computer I could make a difference in the world. Though I never intended thought?horizon to become a major contributor it served its purpose of getting my ideas into order and sparking some ideas in others.

In the past 12 months I have had some significant changes occur in my life. I moved back to my home town and started, in earnest, a new business. [Successus](http://successus.com.au) takes much of my time now and as principal coach I'm involved in helping others directly. Knowledge management is still a part of that but only a small one. In Successus I am taking coaching into some new areas which is a fantastic challenge to be creating for myself.

This site will remain online for at least 12 months from today in recognising that others have links to it and some of the commentary may still even be relevant! Some of the material will appear in the [Successus newsletter](http://successus.com.au/unfolding/index.php) with a slightly different flavour. One which incorporates my learning of the past 12 months. I'm also planning to re-attune my keyboard to [Quantum Gardener](https://quantumgardener.info), which has a strong focus on coaching and represents my alter-ego.

Thank you for your support. Take care and live well,

David C. Buchan
