Shawn Callahan extols [the virtues of using photos](http://www.anecdote.com.au/ archives/2005/09/using_photos_to.html) to remember what has happened on a project.

> Remember the last time you sat down to flick through a photo album and see the photo of Uncle Johnnie (substitute your own relatives here) building the sand castle with little Katie and you instantly recollect the story of how Johnnie got incredibility drunk that night and fell into the bonfire. The next morning he vowed to be a tea totaller. The same story recollecting effect can be created in your organisation with each each project you undertake. I really like this idea and agree that [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) is a good solution. If you're reluctant to start a photo archive today it may be because you are thinking...
> - I don't have time to categorise everything so that I can find it again — well, [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) uses tags which are quick and sorts by date using the information from the digital camera itself. Photos of a project ar relevant to the people that were on it. They will remember the categories/stories themselves. For others it really doesn't matter so there is no need to invest the time
> - I don't have time to take good photos or I'm not a good photographer — who cares? You want to capture the moment as it was, not as you thought it should be portrayed.
>  - The rest of the world will see us or the client will wonder why we are taking photos rather than doing work — injecting some humanity into work is always a good thing. And the rest of the world? Perhaps you will inspire them.
