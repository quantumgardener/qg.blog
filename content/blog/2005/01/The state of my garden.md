It's 34C. The humidity inside has risen high enough that the evaporative air conditioner doesn't seem to be working and everything feels a little clammy. I know that if I turn it off the house will heat quickly. My 7 month old daughter is having trouble sleeping but she has to, because tonight we go to meet her carers at creche before she begins on Friday.

Tomorrow will be 38C but at least it's a public holiday for Australia Day.
After working for two years building a business I can finally say it has arrived and just in time too. All of a sudden we have work opportunities and a much clearer sense of purpose and confidence. It's amazing how it can tip so suddenly.
As always my mind is awash with learning and ideas. After reading ["Gaming the System" by James Rieley](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/ 0273654195/qid=1106632237/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-0121426-8479170? v=glance&s=books) I was reminded of the value of systems thinking and that is something I've never really managed to learn. Now I have the perfect context in which to do and have purchased relevant books on the subject.

You will have seen posts about The Tipping Point. That set up a whole new way to look at marketing with a focus on connectors, mavens and salespeople rather than brochures etc.

In Feb I am one of three instructors on a 3-day coaching program called [Coaching in Action](http://successus.com.au/node/view/21). Effectively the first 3 days of the Diploma of Ontological Coaching. As a coaching program we found few takers. As a leadership and professional development program we have enough to run the course at a profit.

The business is taking on a project approach this year and we have identified no less than 30 major activities to undertake in the name of building a company which is self-sustaining. Those of you who are employees probably don't recognise the support systems which sit quietly around you.

I am working well. Enjoying the company of people I meet and finding ways to help them. My mood is good but my body could do with some more sleep. I'm loving it.

It is, however, still hot.
