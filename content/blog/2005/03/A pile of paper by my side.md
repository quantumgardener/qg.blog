I've recently taken to jotting down notes during phone calls on a pile of scrap
paper which sits beside my keyboard. The effect is threefold.

- I rely a little less on my memory of the conversation
- I am able to listen better because I'm not filing as I go
- I get to use the back side of so many useless printouts

It's been really surprising what a difference it makes. I've always had a reluctance
against taking notes because I thought it interfered with my thinking. A
conversation with my business partner led to the idea and then it was backed up
by some thoughts from [Listening Leaders: The Ten Golden Rules To Listen, Lead & Succeed](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1592980732/), which I'm currently reading.
