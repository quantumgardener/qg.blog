It has taken a few weeks and now *The Quantum Garden* is open to all visitors. I've learned a lot along the way as I moved from [[Wordpress to Quartz]] including:

- [[Designing The Quantum Garden|Revisiting what I thought a Digital Garden is]]
- Plenty of Typescript and Javascript
- Some about how I think of my knowledge

Bottom line. Of all the versions of websites and blogs I've had in the past, this time it finally feels done and I can focus on learning and content.
