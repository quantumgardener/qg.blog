I once heard the suggestion that a gravestone is more reflective of the people that commission it than the person who has died.

It’s similar to you buying a present for someone that you’d really like to receive yourself.

And that’s similar to pet owners more concerned with discussing the breed of their pet rather than how their pet is part of their life.

Makes me wonder what’s most important.
