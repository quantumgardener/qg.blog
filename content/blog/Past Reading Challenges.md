As I [[Workflow for Importing my Old Blog Entries|add my old blog posts]] to this site I came across my [[50 Book Challenge for 2012 Kicking Off]] post.

For the record I only ready 29 books in the end. Those were the days when I read physical books. Now I read only ebooks and my target is 20,000 pages a year, not a number of books.

Thatâ€™s a much better metric for me to chase.

The mix has shifted substantially from non-fiction to fiction. I need to swing that back to more of a balance.
