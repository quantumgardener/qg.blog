Time and time again I see examples of wastage in the workplace because people fail to acknowledge their knowledge, instead falling into habits of manager-subordinate behaviour.

On Friday afternoon whilst waiting for a train, I overheard a man complaining to his friend about the lack of understanding his boss had. It's not the first time I've heard or even created a conversation like this.

> ”So he asked me to go through the project plan and identify the key points for which we require training. I suggested getting the team involved and he said, 'No, do it yourself and come back to me in two hours'."
> 
> “I went through the list and saw him two hours later. Guess what?! He asked me for the WBS[^1], took out a highlighter and circled seven items, none of which I had. Once I had the list, I was able to fill in the details required."
> 
> “He just doesn't understand and has no idea of how to manage people.

There are several points of note:
- The man asked to have the team involved, recognising he didn't have all the knowledge that the team had.
- His boss/manager knew all along what he wanted but in the interests of delegating and giving somebody else to work, failed to acknowledge he already had an answer in his head
- Two hours was wasted trying to second-guess an answer. That hits the bottom line and morale as well. This is the direct value of applying knowledge.
- And finally, be conscious of where you are speaking and who may listening. Some things you may not want shared.
