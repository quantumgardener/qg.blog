Another member of the knowledge management fraternity has discovered k-logging (a specific form of [[Blogging]] which is a brand name for the more generic weblog). 

[[Shawn Callahan]] is like all others with [his exuberance](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/act-km/message/1566) of this topic and rightly so - for it is powerful and quite possibly speaks of true internet publishing for the masses.
This site is built on k-logging principles.

Like all great technology solutions, complexity increases quickly and I'm starting to struggle with conversion between mediums. My preference is blogging because it

- forces me to think more about an idea before posting due to the public nature of the audience
- forces me to post because I have an audience otherwise good ideas get left by the wayside
- is part of my personal "KM" strategy
- makes me feel part of a community
- allows me to include and comment on the posts of others via the RSS newsfeed protocol, and for others to comment our my posts

The struggle comes with the integration of multiple mediums, namely email and discussion groups. I want everything in one place. "Radio" does it well for RSS feeds through the News Aggregator but even that is [causing problems for some] (http://radio.weblogs.com/0107808/2002/09/25.html#a417). It is too difficult (read takes too long) to convert from one format to another, most particularly when I want to post comment on something in a discussion group.

This may be just a rant, for if I deem the knowledge valuable enough it gets done. But I'm conscious that it doesn't get done in all cases and thats the rub.
