[Mathemagenic](http://radio.weblogs.com/0109961/2002/09/03.html#a214) has made an observation around discussions and learning.

> An observation: best discussions happen when you don't have pen and paper, around a dinner table or in a bar. Next morning you come back and try to capture them, but not much left. I wonder, probably the value of this discussions not in their result (something to be captured), but in learning experiences you go through.
 
I wonder if it is also to do with the environment and our trust of that. Dinner table and bar discussions are often less guarded. People even pro-actively defer discussions until the pub on Friday night for that reason. So, being conscious of our location can have a great effect on the stories we tell and the strategies we employ.
