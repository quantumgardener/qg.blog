The *Learning to Fly* discussion group is currently holding a discussion on [Definitions of KM](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/learning-to-fly/message/571? threaded=1). It is worth reading to show how many different definitions there are. It is not surprising given we all have our own different experiences and interpretations on what knowledge is. I don't think there ever will be one definition and advise you to find something that works for you. This is more eloquently put by Patrice Jackson.

> Through your research you will find many senior leaders have many definitions, but you must conclude for yourself what you believe it to be, that is the only way you will get others to understand.

Look for the learning in everything.
