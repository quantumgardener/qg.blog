A while ago I was sent this message from [ninemsn Groups](http:// groups.msn.com/home.msnw?pgmarket=en-au), the Australian arm of the Microsoft network.

> ninemsn Communities will become ninemsn Groups this summer. Groups more accurately conveys what we're all about?people with similar interests building a group around those interests. In addition, 'Groups' is rapidly becoming the standard term for this type of service. 'Groups' is simpler, more precise, and a lot easier to type.

Mob is even easier.

If group is more accurate than community, it can only be because there is no duty of care as would be expected of a community. That's why in the knowledge management arena we strive to create [[Community of practice]] and not groups of people. Within a Community of Practice there is a common sense of purpose, caring and trust for fellow community members.
