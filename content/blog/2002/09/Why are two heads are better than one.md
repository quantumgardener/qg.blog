title: Why are two heads better than one?
---
I'm a big fan of [V8 Supercar racing](https://www.supercars.com) so I took note when I saw an interview with [Paul Morris](http://www.paulmorris.com.au/) on [RPM](http://www.rpmlive.tv/). Paul was talking about how his team will have two cars in the championship next year because of the extra knowledge they will gain. Two cars may cost more to run but they do twice as many laps and therefore generate twice as much information for the team. This translates into quicker "dialling in" to the track and so improves their chances of winning. Work teams should simulate this type of experience by actively creating opportunities to share and apply knowledge. Knowing what the other team has learnt will lead you to quicker completion of your own tasks and thereby winning the race.
