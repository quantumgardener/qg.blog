In her introduction, [Janice Reid](http://radio.weblogs.com/0110051/) raises an interesting point about what happens if you focus too much on learning about the company you work for. I'll let Janet's words explain.

> One thing that I've learnt recently is that there's a limit to what one's learning when working with a corporate. After a couple of years you start to capture more about the company, rather than building your own functional knowledge. You create a personal database of information which is very valuable to your work colleagues, but worthless to you once you move on. In hindsight I would recommend 'job hopping' in order to develop your personal knowledge of different environments, ways of doing things, attitudes etc, rather than a prolonged period at any one firm, even if you are frequently changing roles.
