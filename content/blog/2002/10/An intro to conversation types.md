In my day-to-day interactions with people I use [[Types of conversation]] to maximise the effectiveness of the conversation. The concept of conversational types is grounded in the work of [[Fernando Flores]].

These multiple types of conversation are:
- [[Conversation for stories and assessments]]
- [[Conversation for clarity]]
- [[Conversation for co-ordination of action]] 
- [[Conversation for speculation or possible action]]
- [[Conversation for possible conversations]]
- [[Conversation for relationship]]
- [[Conversation for appreciation or complaint]]
- [[Conversation for second order learning]]

This list is particularly useful for "KM" because they can break down many of the objections that people may raise. By stating that "I want to have a [[Conversations for speculation or possible action]]" upfront shifts people to a different frame of mind and regularly makes their response more open. Alternatively, knowing you are in a "[[Conversations for co-ordination of action]]" makes for quick decisions.

Some examples of the conversation types are:
- *Conversation for stories and assessments* — conversations that share experiences or your understanding of what has happened. — *Conversations for clarity* - this post is a conversation for clarity about Conversation Types.
- *Conversation for co-ordination of action* —- typically planning meetings where the objective is to understand everybody's role on the team. "You do this. I'll do that".
- *Conversation for speculation or possible action* — brainstorming, scenario planning.
- *Conversation for possible conversations* — a simple form but often necessary to set up a conversation at a later date. Usually of the form "Lets meet on Monday to have a conversation for clarity about..."
- *Conversation for relationship* — conversations that build shared experience with others and improve your relationship.
- *Conversation for appreciation or complaint* — predominantly of the latter form, this type of conversation is all about feedback.
- *Conversation for second order learning* — reflective conversations in which we learn.

Too often, especially in meetings, the conversation jumps from mode to mode and nothing is achieved. By knowing which type of conversation you are entering (or wish to create) you are able to increase the chance the objective of the conversation will be met.

The paper ["Conversations as a medium for change in education"](http://carbon.cudenver.edu/lsherry/courses/jenlink.html) provides further distinction around the conversation types. I prefer to work from the simple list above.
