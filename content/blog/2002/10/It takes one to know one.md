This childhood taunt rings true today, even in the field of knowledge management. Knowledge sharing becomes easier when we take the time to consider the other person and their past experience. As the saying suggests, if we don't know one (i.e.. recognise another's point-of-view based on their experience) we will not be able to share knowledge. First we must work to bridge the experience gap. And that is our responsibility to initiate and manage, not theirs. It is a great mindset to be in to start [[Knowledge flow]]
