A week or so ago a friend sent me an article on the Play Ethic. Pat Kane is advocating that after two centuries of domination by the work ethic, the play ethic has arrived.

I'm recommending that everybody takes a close look at [The Play Ethic](https://www.theplayethic.com/what-is-the-play-ethic.html). It describes a way out of the malady that is striking at the heart of business today.

[[Alan Silcock]] and I have been playing in this manner for several months now. Isn't it great when you have a name to put to something that you've been sensing and living for a while.
