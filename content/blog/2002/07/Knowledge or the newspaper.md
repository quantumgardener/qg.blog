Whilst sitting on a beach a CEO was asked "What's been your greatest lesson as a CEO?"

He replied. "Each morning when I came into work I would see an employee who spent the first 45 minutes of his day reading the newspaper from front to back. After a while I fired him. It was the most expensive knowledge mistake that I have ever made. I didn't bother to understand what that employee really contributed. Rather I focused on the financial cost of his time reading the paper".

It is important that when making business decisions we consider the knowledge impact of our actions. Otherwise we leave ourselves open to greater costs further down the track.
