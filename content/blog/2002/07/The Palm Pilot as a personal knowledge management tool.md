## Introduction
This article is a work in progress. The tools that I use on my Palm change as my needs change. Consequently there will be both additions and retirements from the list below. I will also be posting articles on how to best use some of the tools below and will create the relevant links from here as appropriate.

My brain can hold a lot of things but it's not always the best at recalling or organising them. For support I use a Palm Pilot as my personal digital assistant (PDA). It is a key component of personal knowledge management. Below I will share how and why I find a Palm so useful. If you are a Pocket PC fan (or other such piece of hardware), don't despair. There will be something here for you as well.
## I use my Palm for keeping organised
PDAs were originally glorified diaries. They added the ability to change information without crossing it out and search functions. Everything that has come after is could be said to be pretty much the same - only the interface is easier.

I rely heavily on my Palm's datebook, to-do and address functions for when I'm out of the office or without my note book. It stores much more information than I can possibly hold in my head and I can make changes without resorting to lots of bits of paper. More recently I have come to rely even more heavily on
ShadowPlan as it lends itself to David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://%20gettingthingsdone.com/) method.

**DateBk5** from Pimlico Software - DateBk is a replacement for the built-in Palm datebook application. It extends the base application with a number of features. I find the categorising, icons and quick setting of a new day or time the most useful. I have only just begun using views. It adds many more useful features to the built-in datebook application such as categorised dates, icon and integrated to-do/memo/ address lists. Read the manual to make the most use of the features available, otherwise you may as well stick with the built-in application.

**PocketMirror Professional** from Chapura - PocketMirror is a replacement conduit with great flexibility. It supports most of Outlooks functions including categories and folders to categories. PocketMirror Provides strong synchronisation between DateBk5 and Microsoft Outlook, making use of the best features of each although it takes some playing around to get the way of working that suits you best but well worth it when you do. Back up your data in case you hit a config that doesn't work. You shouldn't lose data but you don't want to change 500 address entries in your address book do you?.

**KeyContacts** from Chapura - Replacement for the built-in address book. Supports multiple categories per address, all of Outlook's fields and has a great lookup feature. Enter 'brian' and you will get all people whose name begins with Brian or who have Brian as a surname. A downside is that KeyContacts uses a non-standard database so those applications which link to the built-in address book can't link to this.

**ShadowPlan** from codejedi - ShadowPlan is an outliner that is best trialled to be understood. With it you can create multiple checklists in order to help manage your life. However, it also can be used to send links to your datebook (or DateBk5) as needed. There are strong filtering and highlighting capabilities as well. The desktop application offers only about 30% of the functionality of the palm component. Read the shadow tips file that comes with the distribution. And of course, the manual as well.
## I use my Palm for Mind Mapping
I carry my most important mind maps with me for quick reference or minor updates. Mind Maps are recognised as a very compact way of storing a lot of knowledge and I have several that I rely upon. Having them close by on my Palm is easier than carrying paper or my notebook around. I don't have all of the flexibility but then I don't need it. The intent is to remind myself of an idea - not do develop it. However, I often tweak maps with new ideas as they come to mind.

**MindManager Mobile** from Mindjet - Good for quick changes. Synchronisation requires MindManager Business Edition on the PC. Once below first level, devolves to a tree structure and so the "mind map" element is lost. Synchronisation takes a long time compared to other applications. Maps created on the Palm are stored in your "My Documents" directory. You have to move and then re-add them using the organiser if you want to store in a different location. 
## I use my Palm for reading books
Every know and then you come across a written reference that you want to keep with you but carrying around a pile of books all the time looks a bit nerdy (yes, we all agree that Palm Pilots and the like are the height of coolness). Depending on the form of the source you might be able to transfer it to your Palm Pilot.

Right now I only have the first draft of my brother's novel on my Palm but in the past I've had reference documents on eBusiness and even a novel or two for the train. I am also reading Sun Tzu's "The Art of War"

**iSilo** (offline web browser) - Able to transfer websites to your Palm and stays very true to form but there is no abilty to schedule updates
plucker (offline web browser) - Able to transfer websites on a scheduled basis to your palm but doesn't get all the formatting right.

**PalmReader** from Palm Digital Press - Simple interface great for text only documents. Turn the display sideways as it makes holding the Palm and reading one handed a lot easier.

**Acrobat Reader for Palm OS** from Adobe - Takes pdf files and stores them on the Palm. Handles graphics well but not perfectly. To be fair, this is a limitation of the Palm and not the reader. Stick to the simpler formatted pdf files if possible. Something with heavy graphics won't work well (and it will take a lot of space as well).
## I use my Palm for keeping notes 
Just had a good idea? Write it down.

**MemoPad**, built-in note application - Simple to use. Organisation is by category only with no hierarchy. Notes are limited to 4K in size. You would never create one so big on the Palm but sometimes you want to store notes from a note book which may be bigger.
## I use my Palm for secret squirrel activities
How many accounts and passwords do you have. At a quick count I'm around the 100 mark and I can't remember them all, nor can I trust to write them down. I use an application called Secret! and it's companion Secret! Desktop to manage all my account and password details. The advantage is they are stored in an MD5 encrypted database making them harder to access. It's a compromise between remembering/forgetting and having to write them somewhere.

**Secret!** from LinkeSoft - Secure storage. Desktop companion software. Long lists of categories can be difficult to navigate. Like all Palm applications (an in fact Knowledge Management in general) think first about how you want to categorise your data.
## I use my Palm for ...
The Palm is a wonderfully versatile piece of equipment. In addition to the above I also use my Palm for a game or two and astronomy. We can't do knowledge management all of the time.
## Other essential pieces of software for your Palm
In addition to the above, all Palm users should consider **BackupBuddy** from Blue Nomad - This should be the first piece of software you buy after purchasing your Palm. It ensures quick recovery in the event of failure because it makes sure everything is backed up.

**JackFlash** from Brayder Technologies - squeezes that little extra bit of memory.
