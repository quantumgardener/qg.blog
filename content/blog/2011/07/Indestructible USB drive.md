Two weeks ago I realised I had misplaced my Sandisk Cruzer 32GB USB drive. Confident there was no critical data on it I chalked it up to experience and purchased a replacement, the remarkable Sandisk Cruzer Blade 16GB. Why not buy a replacement that is 1/4 the physical dimensions of something you’ve just lost.

Yesterday, when ironing a pair of trousers I found my 32GB USB. It had been through the washing machine, hung outside all day in a wet pocket and then been passed over by a hot iron.

Not confident of success I inserted it into a computer and all my data was there.

I’ve since done 24 hours of write testing (10 complete passes) and it passed. Truly amazing. Now, where did I put it?
