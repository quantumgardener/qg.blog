I need a whiteboard for my office but I can't seem to bring myself to spend AUD $200 for the size I need. I thought there must be an answer and went searching on the Web. It didn't take long to find a couple of really excellent resources which I've listed below.

- [The 90's answer to the chalkboard?](http://www.teachnet.com/how-to/manage/ 082398.html)
- [Whiteboards on a Zero Budget](http://www.teachnet.com/how-to/manage/ 091998.html)

I haven't made one yet because I don't know where to put it!
