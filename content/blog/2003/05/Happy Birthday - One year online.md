Yesterday marked one year of [[Thought Horizon (Business)|thought?horizon]] and I was lucky enough to spend it in reflection with a friend who had travelled with me along the way.

When I started thought?horizon it was to organise the wealth of ideas that were pouring into my head from all sides on the topics of knowledge management and learning. Little did I know it would become a way of connecting with others and a history of my thinking.

Most surprising and rewarding have been the benefits of writing publicly. First and most important is the network of friends I have made around the world. In this realm there is an amazing amount of trust and collaboration which is a great role-model for interactions outside of the blogging fraternity. Secondly and also very important is that through thought?horizon I have had a positive impact on the lives of others which is important to me. I wished to give back some of what I have learnt and it seems I have done so.

During the recent transition to [movabletype](http://www.thoughthorizon.com/archives/000362.php) I revisited all the postings I've made and found it interesting to see where I have changed along the way. New ideas and perspectives change my understanding of earlier posts and remind me of what is important.

Thank you to all who have supported me throughout this past year.
Be well, 
David
