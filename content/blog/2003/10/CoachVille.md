Yesterday I came across [CoachVille](http://www.coachville.com/), a site dedicated to improving the quality of coaching worldwide. The style of coaching offered is quite different from the ontological coaching yet there are some tools which will be useful. I haven't had time to work through the whole site yet but there are examples of language distinctions (their "Distinctionary" is a great resource) and also 50+ hours of live coaching sessions.

Take a look. You have to join as a member but membership is free until Dec 31 this year. Once you have joined you get to see all that is available and use it for yourself.
