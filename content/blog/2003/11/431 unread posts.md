I've been busy lately and have neglected to keep up with my [NewsGator](http:// www.newsgator.com) RSS feeds. This evening I have 431 of them. With so many I have found two patterns of reading. If there aren't that many entries I work from the main NewsGator page and scroll through the excerpts, usually deleting whatever doesn't seem interesting. After a while I give up on that as an interface and drop into the individual folders associated with each feed. This is much more efficient because I'm reading everything in context of the author (c/f the date context presented by the main NewsGator page). Decisions about what to explore further or delete are easier. The downside is blogs starting with Z don't get seen that often when I tire.

What ways do you use your news aggregator?
