›Let’s say you’re measuring your behaviour, success, etc. and you fail to meet the ideals of the standard you’re comparing to. You will either:

2. Put unrealistic pressure on yourself to close the gap.

There is a third choice. Almost always overlooked. Adjust the standard to something that’s realistic for you.
