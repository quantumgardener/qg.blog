My proposed list of alternative day names to help us organise time easier and avoid confusion across the week. Some are already in use which leads me to believe I’m onto something.

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon | Evening     |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Today     | Tomorn    | Tonoon    | Tonight     |
| Yesterday | Last-morn | Last-noon | Last night  |
| Tomorrow  | Tommorn   | Tomnoon   | Tomnight    |
| Monday    | Momorn    | Monoon    | Monight     |
| Tuesday   | Tumorn    | Tunoon    | Tunight(†)  |
| Wednesday | Wemorn    | Wenoon    | Wenight     |
| Thursday  | Thmorn    | Thnoon    | Thnight     |
| Friday    | Frimorn   | Frinoon   | Frinight(‡) |
| Saturday  | Satmorn   | Satnoon   | Satnight    |
| Sunday    | Sumorn    | Sumorn    | Sunight     |

(†) Similar to Tonight. It's all in the inflection. 

(‡) Don’t confuse with the 1985 classic vampire move _[Fright Night](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089175/)_ or the gastronomic “Fry night”.

Examples:
* “Hey Julie. So glad it’s Frinoon. Do you want to go to the movies Tomnight?”
* “Last Thmorn I had coffee with my Dad.”

The major obstacle to this new nomenclature are today’s spell checkers. All will have to be reconfigured.
