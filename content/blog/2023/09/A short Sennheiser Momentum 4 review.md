For the last 4-5 years I've used my Sennheiser 4.50BTNC headphones every day. The BTNC stands for Bluetooth and Noise Cancelling.

For Christmas 2022 I was gifted a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones. They are two generations newer and a level above the 4.50BTNCs.

Differences:
- better fit on the ears 
- not as tight on the head 
- wider soundstage 
- clearer sound 
- improved bass
- better noise cancelling
- insane battery life (close to 60 hours)
