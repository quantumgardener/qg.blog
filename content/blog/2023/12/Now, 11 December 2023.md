Christmas and the end of the work year are upon us. Last year my mental state was poor though I didn't fully realise that until after the holidays. I wrote [[R U OK at Christmas]] not realising it was for me more than anyone else.

This year I'm in a much better position. Tired and in need of a break, but from the work and not the mental stress. I have a total of 24 days off work which will be great. I don't have much planned other than playing with my new [[Canon R50 Mirrorless]] camera (sssh who put that under the tree!) and some [[Baldur's Gate 3]]. There may be a quick trip to [[Adelaide]] at the end to help my daughter and her boyfriend move there for work.

I will spend some time over the break checking in with myself and goals. Funny how I plan to do that then, rather than do so now.
