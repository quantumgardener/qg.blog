Ever since I first understood kings, queens and coronations I’ve wanted to see one in my lifetime. Of course it did mean someone had to die first but that is honestly part of the wonder of it all.

I must say that I was expecting more usurpers and armies marching on London from what I’ve read in books and seen in the movies. Should be wizard somewhere as well.
