My daughter is an avid reader and loves the library. This week she brought home a copy of ["What Dad's Can't Do"](https://douglaswood.com/product/what-dads-cant-do/) by Douglas Wood.

Here's a summary from the website.

> There are lots of things that regular people can do but dads can't.
> Dads can't cross the street without holding hands.
> They can push, but they can't swing.
> When dads play hide-and-seek they always get found, but they have a hard time finding you.
> Dads really need to be kissed good night at bedtime.
> It's a wonder they make it through life at all!
