Clearly [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is broken as a social media platform ðŸ˜„

| Platform                                                            | Constant nagging ads |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Facebook                                                            | Yes                  |
| <strike>Twitter</strike>X                                                             | Yes                  |
| Instagram                                                           | Yes                  |
| YouTubre                                                            | Yes                  |
| Mastodon (and other [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party) platforms) | NO ðŸŽ‰                |

And it gets worse. The lack of ads make it possible to actually read what other people are writing. Even to respond back and forth to each other.
