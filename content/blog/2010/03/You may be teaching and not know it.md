On Saturday my family and I spoke via Skype video to our dear friends in the UK. They're visiting next month and we thought it would be good for the children to all speak and see each other first as they have never met.

I was shepherding the conversation with phrases such as, "Ask about X", "Tell them about Y" and so on. It was a little frustrating at the time that my girls weren't saying much. At first I thought they were shy but now I'm not so sure. Rather, it was such a new situation for them they had to be taught how to converse. My prompts were as much about teaching them what could be said as they were to get them to speak on the day.

As a parent we have responsibilities in all areas of life. I've been aware of the need to introduce my girls to new social situations but it has ended there. I've never known the responsibility I then had to help them through it or noted when I've done so until Saturday. I hope to be more effective next time around and believe the lesson learnt here is broadly applicable in life. The fine distinction between telling and educating. The latter invokes the [[Legitimate other]].
