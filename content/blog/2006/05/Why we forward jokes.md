My uncle sent me this. I don't know the original source but I'm thankful for having received it. It explains why we forward jokes.

> A man and his dog were walking along a road. The man was enjoying the scenery, when it suddenly occurred to him that he was dead.
> 
> He remembered dying, and that the dog walking beside him had been dead for years. He wondered where the road was leading them.
> 
> After a while, they came to a high, white stone wall along one side of the road. It looked like fine marble. At the top of a long hill, it was broken by a tall arch that glowed in the sunlight.
> 
> When he was standing before it he saw a magnificent gate in the arch that looked like mother-of-pearl, and the street that led to the gate looked like pure gold. He and the dog walked toward the gate, and as he got closer, he saw a man at a desk to one side.
> 
> When he was close enough, he called out, "Excuse me, where are we?"
> 
> "This is Heaven, sir," the man answered.
> 
> "Wow! Would you happen to have some water?" the man asked.
> 
> Of course, sir. Come right in, and I'll have some ice water brought right up."
> The man gestured, and the gate began to open.
> 
> "Can my friend," gesturing toward his dog, "come in, too?" the traveler asked.
> 
> "I'm sorry, sir, but we don't accept pets."
> 
> The man thought a moment and then turned back toward the road and continued the way he had been going with his dog.
> 
> After another long walk, and at the top of another long hill, he came to a dirt road leading through a farm gate that looked as if it had never been closed. There was no fence.
> 
> As he approached the gate, he saw a man inside, leaning against a tree and reading a book.
> 
> "Excuse me!" he called to the man. "Do you have any water?"
> 
> "Yeah, sure, there's a pump over there, come on in."
> 
> "How about my friend here?" the traveler gestured to the dog.
> 
> "There should be a bowl by the pump."
> 
> They went through the gate, and sure enough, there was an old-fashioned hand pump with a bowl beside it.
> 
> The traveler filled the water bowl and took a long drink himself, then he gave some to the dog.
> 
> When they were full, he and the dog walked back toward the man who was standing by the tree.
> 
> "What do you call this place?" the traveler asked. 
> 
> "This is Heaven," he answered.
> 
> "Well, that's confusing," the traveler said. "The man down the road said that was Heaven, too."
> 
> "Oh, you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates? Nope. That's hell." "Doesn't it make you mad for them to use your name like that?"
> 
> "No, we're just happy that they screen out the folks who would leave their best friends behind."
> 
> Soooo...
> 
> Sometimes, we wonder why friends keep forwarding jokes to us without writing a word.
> 
> Maybe this will explain.
> 
> When you are very busy, but still want to keep in touch, guess what you do? You forward jokes.
> 
> When you have nothing to say, but still want to keep contact, you forward jokes.
> 
> When you have something to say, but don't know what, and don't know how, you forward jokes.
> 
> Also to let you know that you are still remembered, you are still important, 
> you are still loved, you are still cared for, guess what you get?
> 
> A forwarded joke.

So, next time if you get a joke, don't think that you've been sent just another forwarded joke, but that you've been thought of today and your friend on the other end of your computer wanted to send you a smile

You are all welcome at my water bowl anytime.
