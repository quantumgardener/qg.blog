Clarity is always important. Megan Casey over at SquidBlog provides [a great tip and example](http://www.squidoo.com/blog/?p=68) of how clarity can enhance a book referral. If you read it and apply the principles, you can see how you can expand your blog linking as well. If you network, the same applies there as well when describing ideal clients to others and how you would like them to introduce you in your absence.

> P.S. So, what makes a good recommendation?
1. First-person experience.
2. Enthusiasm.
3. Specificity.
4. Sincerity.
5. Clarity.

The difference between good (action-inducing) and bad (zzzzzz) recommendations is the difference between one person saying:

> “I’ve read a lot of history books, but this is the best I’ve ever found on the Roman Empire, and if you read it you will have a firm grasp on Roman history and architecture and I guarantee you’ll be booking the next flight to Italy.” 

and the other saying, 

> “I guess I liked this novel, but you probably won’t.”

Which book would you buy?
