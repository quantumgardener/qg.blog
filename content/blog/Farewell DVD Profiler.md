For more years than I can remember I've used [DVD Profiler](http://www.invelos.com) to log my DVD, Bluray and 4K movies. Despite not being updated since 2017, it still works well and remains supported by a community who crowd-source data on latest releases.

Each time I bought a movie on disc I would enter the UPC and match to the existing releases. DVD Profiler would then download artistic and technical details about the move. Rarely would I have to contribute details for a disc I couldn't match[^australia]. Then I would add where I purchased the title, when and for how much. Prior to the release of the mobile version I would print a customised report[^hours].

The program became really valuable when I began throwing out movie packaging and storing the discs in numbered sleeves. I was able to add the slot number as a reference. Want to watch [[12 Angry Men]]? That's box A, sleeve pocket 81.

Times have changed and I rarely place a disc into my [[Sony UBP-X700 4K Bluray player]]. I have so much to watch I don't go back to movies I've bought, and of course, streaming has had a huge impact. The physical media I do watch are the 4K UHD Dolby Vision movies where I want the best picture I can get.

Streaming has had such an impact that last year I threw out 2/3 of my collection because there are viable streaming alternatives. The reality is, if I lost my movie collection, there are maybe a dozen titles I'd want to re-purchase. The only information I need to keep now is the record of what sleeve a movie is in.

Lately I've been tracking books, gaming and movies in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). The reference to [[12 Angry Men]] above links to my notes on the movie[^12angrymen]. With information in DVD Profiler I have two information stores to manage. The only data I need now about my purchase of a movie is where I've stored it. So, sadly, after about 18 years, I'll generate a report of movies with their slot numbers for the final time and delete it from my PC and mobile.


[^australia]: Mostly for the Australian version of a title.
[^12angrymen]: One of my favourite films of all time and the arrival of the 4K version today prompted this post.
[^hours]: Too many hours spent tweaking layouts. How many movies could I have watched in that time?
