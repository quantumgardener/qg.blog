bgAlways remember to ask for help if you need it. On Monday I let my General Manager know that I was struggling to find work to do. It is not a position I like being in.[^1] Sure solved the problem. I had work throughout the week and will have work this next week as well. It's all internal work, but needs doing.

Tuesday taught me something else. I had two client meetings with me in an advisory position. The difference between one that didn't want any advice and the other that did was astonishing. I felt so much better being able to help and that's all that I want to do. Thursday backed up with another similar conversation. My assessment is that the core difference is one of learning position. Are all parties in the conversation learners? If not, it's hard. I'll ruminate on this further. My gut feeling is this points me more directly to the type of work I enjoy doing the most and I'd like for more of that to happen.

I smashed out a Mastodon post on Thursday afternoon. Hadn't thought about it in advance and simply typed what came to mind. I've uploaded it here as [[Just so you know]]. I'm astonished and grateful for the 138 likes and 101 boosts it's received. Not at all a large number in the scheme of such things, but the largest ever for me. It has resonated with more than a few.

Finally, I got out an article yesterday on [[My GTD weekly review steps]]. Still have to finish it with some code examples. I hadn't copied enough of them from my work laptop. Where I can, I share what I do here so others can benefit. I learn a lot from the sharing of others so it's me paying it forward.

Finally, finally! Worked this afternoon on identifying all my home network devices by MAC address. I have 60 non-connected items. Not worried about that. I suspect they are all devices we no longer own, or a few that are turned off. This is step 1 in working towards setting up a dedicated [[Internet of Things]] VLAN, separated from our more important home network assets. I'm thinking I'll document what I learn as I go.
## What I'm playing
Pretty much done with [[No Man's Sky]] now. I've gotten very deep into the game and have completed all that I want to. Next will be [[A Plague Tale - Requiem]]. Meditated this weekend with a fair amount of [[PowerWash Simulator]].
## What I'm reading
I finished [[The Book that Broke the World]]. Looking forward to the final in the trilogy later this year. Have started [[The Last Graduate]] which is book 2 in the [[Scholmance series]] and will also begin this evening after this post [[Listening for Candor]]. Fellow coach alumni [[Phillip Crockford]] recommended it highly to me as a way to help filter through all that I'm thinking of.
