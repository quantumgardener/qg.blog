I have made the decision to enable basic page visit analytics on http://quantumgardener.info and have configured [[tinylytics]]. I had always flagged this may happen one day and if it did committed to a blog post advising people.

Simply put, I need some visibility on which pages are being viewed. In the future I can see myself writing some content behind a paywall (hey, got to make a living) and knowing what is most viewed will be helpful in making that decision. It will also protect against deleting content people find useful of which I'm not aware.
