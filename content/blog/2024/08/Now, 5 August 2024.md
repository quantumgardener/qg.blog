I've been going to start this entry multiple times and never started. In the spirit of something is better than nothing, here I go.

There has been a big change in my life. In early May I started a trial of taking some Friday's off work as annual leave (see [[Friday on my mind]]) and found that I was mentally awake again in the evenings, and was looking forward to my weekend. I can't recall when I last looked forward to a weekend.

After a lot of thinking, discussions with my wife, salary math, and feeling like shit returning to 5 days a week for a few weeks, I began my first official 4 day week on 15 July. 

The first weekend I spent a lot of time doing [[Trapped!|busy work on my website]] and that continued throughout the second week of evenings. My mind said, "Hey buddy, you're semi-retired now. Here's everything you want to do. Right now! Get on it!". Recognising this (it gets tiring) I disciplined myself to stay off the computer on the weekend. Week three has been better. 

You might be thinking, "Oh my god. Is he going to describe every week for the rest of his life?" Maybe. But not in terms of working 4 day weeks. What I will be doing is a summary of the week akin to a [now page](https://sive.rs/nowff) as a way for me to reflect and learn. 

## Books I'm reading
- [[Fragile Empire]] by [[Christopher Mitchell]] ([[The Magelands Epic]] book 5). This is an interesting world with multiple races warring and shared magics. I picked up both books 1-4 and 5-8 as very cheap $2-3 dollar collections on Amazon. They deserve better than that.
## Games I'm playing
- Back onto [[No Man's Sky]] at the weekend. It's amazing how far this game has come since the disaster of its over-promised launch. I enjoyed the exploring in [[Elite - Dangerous|Elite: Dangerous]] and once I get back into the mechanics of NMS I'll be off exploring on my own.
