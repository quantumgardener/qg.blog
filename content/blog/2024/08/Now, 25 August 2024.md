I have been looking forward to this entry for the last couple of days and waited until Sunday evening to round out the week. It has been an interesting one that has created some positive [[Breakdown|Breakdowns]] to consider.

Monday started with a trip to Melbourne for a client presentation. I had reviewed a couple of reports and had to deliver my findings. The trip itself was different. We passed police that had seemingly pulled over an alpaca and then had to detour around a freeway accident where an offal truck had lost its load (and I expected those first on the scene their lunch). 

I was on in the presentation. I knew the material and it fit right where I wanted to be as the position of trusted advisor. I took an educated punt on one aspect of the report, reading between the lines, and years of experience proved me correct.

What followed wasn't much fun. A long train trip home, meetings that I was looking forward to during the week cancelled, little-to-no client work to keep me occupied so I spent time uninspired and trying to find things to do. I used up all Thursday afternoon watching YouTube videos to build up my networking knowledge after realising that was a gap I can close.

Friday was my day off, and it's been different since then. I caught up with Caleb Maxwell from [Hebron Films](https://hebronfilms.com). We had crossed paths years ago but no work came out of it. Then a week ago I saw him in a bakery one day, crossing the street against me the next and had a LinkedIn post jump out at me only to find it was him as well. So, I listen when synchronicity calls, and set up a meeting. For me it was a conversation of old. Two people sharing knowledge and experiences â€” with energy and without agenda. I need more of that in my life.

Following from there I've been working on my [[Digital garden]] and can feel strongly things coming together. Technically I added visitor tracking with [[tinylytics]] and I can already see numbers higher than I imagined (which was very low) and I've been adding old entries to my [blog](/blog). With [[Obsidian]] and the other work I've been doing in the garden, I have a good workflow happening. Unless there is a lot of formatting I can turn an old entry around in a few minutes. Many have been added already, and I still have 429 to check. Not all will be added as they are too much of their time. Of the rest it has been validating to see words I wrote as far back as [2002](https://quantumgardener.info/blog/2002/) are still valid and relevant to my thinking today.

Something is emerging. I'm excited to see what that is.
## Books I'm reading
The second of [[Mark Lawrence]]'s [[Library trilogy]] is underway. [[The Book that Broke the World]] has started as the last finished. It's an incredibly complex and rich story. One for the ages. Who would have thought a book set in a library could be so interesting.
## Games I'm playing
[[No Man's Sky]] all the way. Each session I'm learning something more about the mechanics.
