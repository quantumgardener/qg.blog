I have quite a bit of music ripped from CD in [[FLAC]] quality comprising albums that are not available on streaming services including, and this is a travesty, the Original Xanadu Soundtrack!

[[Apple Music]] recognised this is the case for many people and allowed me to upload the audio files to my Apple Music library for streaming anywhere. However, in my household, 3/4 music listeners began on [[Spotify]] and that's where they wanted to stay. I had an Apple Music subscription for 18 months but all things considered it was too expensive to continue with just for me.

I cancelled my subscription and moved back to [[Spotify]] with the help of a [FreeYourMusic](https://freeyourmusic.com) to convert my playlists. Getting my CDs to Spotify was seamless as can be seen in my horrific, completing confusing, unnecessary and fragile [[My Spotify setup|Spotify setup]]. It also had the benefit that it was constrained to only working on music I'd downloaded to my phone. In [[FLAC]] quality that's more that my phone's total storage. Yet, that's not a problem since it doesn't recognise FLAC files on the iPhone anyway. It only plays them through the desktop app so I needed an addition FLAC to MP3 conversion for every album.

Late today I decided to try [[Plexamp]], a companion music player to the amazing [[Plex]] media server[^1] [[Plexamp setup is easy]]. So easy, that it took less time to set up Plexamp than it took for me to decommission [[My Spotify setup]] (under 5 minutes and most of that was [[Plex]] indexing the new files).

It was a nice little drive to get fish-and-chips for tea with TV-2's NÃ¦rmest Lykkelig blasting through the car speakers via the [[Plexamp]] CarPlay integration, streaming directly from my NAS at home.
