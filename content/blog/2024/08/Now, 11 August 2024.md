The Paris Olympics are on their final day and life will return to normal for another 4 years. It's always enjoyable to see new sports but I haven't really connected with the coverage this year. I don't know if it's the time difference, or Channel 9 having too many channels. There is no through-line of story and Channel 9 seem to have drowned in too much choice. Now, if they could only leave Mark Taylor in Paris so that we never hear from him as a commentator again I'll be happy.

Most of my spare time has been playing [[No Man's Sky]]. Exploring space is something I enjoy. If I could do it for real (and on similar timescales as the game) I'd be happy. The game has evolved a lot since it launched and even since I got the [[Platinum trophy]] a little over three years ago. It has taken dedicated focus and chasing down what wasn't working to get back into the mechanics of the game. There is a sense to it all which I'd forgotten about. I probably won't play for a few more days. The risk is staying up late. I did that Wednesday night and by the end of Thursday at work was not the nicest to be around.

An observation was made this week by an external HR consultant at work that they don't see me finishing out my career there. That's not a job security thing, more that I'll move on. Curious.

More website development. Tweaking around the edges. I now have a total page counter at the bottom of each page. You are reading page 401. There are many more to come.
## Books I'm reading
- I finished [[Fragile Empire]] yesterday and have now moved on to [[Blood and Elves]] the first novel in The Witcher series. If I had read it before playing [[The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt]] and watching [[The Witcher (TV series)]] I would have been hooked. Even now it's compelling.
## Games I'm playing
- Pretty much [[No Man's Sky]]. I'm close to finishing the Atlas storyline and have spent most of the weekend upgrading my exosuit, ship and multi-tool.
