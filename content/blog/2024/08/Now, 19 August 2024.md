It was a weekend of things failing. 

Our internet connect has gone a bit flaky recently with random short dropouts. The first NBN tech to look at it suggested local Telstra works had "irritated my line" and  kept the issue open. I was expecting an appointment this coming Friday but instead the a tech turned up Saturday. He confirmed the line is cactus and today I hear it will be replaced. NBN have said they won't be able to get to replacement until July 2025. Really? Right when you were due to upgrade us to fibre. How kind.

Yesterday started with a gully trap overflow. Great. Called our plumber mate who wasn't able to get his tools around the bend and told us to call our local water authority as they have to respond to check the sewerage main etc. I naively thought we could dig down to the pipe to check any blockages. It's 1.7m down. Too big a whole to dig. Water authority turned up and put a high power hose into our line. I assume it's working. They left from within our property without saying anything but the water level has dropped and everything appears ok today.

During the week I read an article that had me very excited. Henrik Karlsson wrote that blog posts are searches for those who think like us[^1] and I found it exciting and liberating. It gives me permission to write what I want trusting people will find it. I don't need to write anything different to attract an audience. Yes, I already knew that and it's strange how sometimes we need other people to give us permission we don't actually need.

I am thinking I'll start organising these posts around my [[Landscapes]]. Not sure about that yet so will continue to think about it. Until then...
## Game I'm playing
Yep, just game and an awful lot of it. [[No Man's Sky]] has had a lot of my attention. I'm learning a lot about the game play and find pottering around in the universe relaxing. I did the same in [[Elite - Dangerous|Elite: Dangerous]], getting the Elite Explorer rank as my first ranking. This week I've upgraded my suit, exotool, ship and freighter, built a couple of mines to harvest resources while I'm asleep and got my head around many of the mechanics I'd missed.

## Books I'm reading
Nearing the last 30 minutes of [[Blood and Elves]].
