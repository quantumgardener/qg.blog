Today I spent some time playing the original [[Resident Evil]]. Games have evolved since 1996 in many more ways than graphics alone. To me it felt a lot like the text adventure [[Zork I]] with graphics. The storytelling structure and gameplay is highly similar between the two. There isn’t enough there to keep me going and I’ve already deleted it.

I played [[Resident Evil 4]] on the [[Nintendo Wii]] console in 2007 as a third-person shooter. It was the first survival horror game I ever played. Quite a different experience and more what I was expecting of the original having known nothing about it before.

I have [[Resident Evil 7]] downloaded and ready to play and soon I hope to be able to play [[Resident Evil Village]] on [[PlayStation VR2]]. That will be quite a different experience again.

Franchise books don’t change format. Franchise movies may improve the graphics but tend to be similar in structure over time. Only gaming can give you such a difference in experience over the generations.
