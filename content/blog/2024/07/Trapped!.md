Last weekend, and through the week since, I made a lot of changes to [[The Quantum Garden]] ([)website)[http://quantumgardener.info]. 

> [!example] Website changes
> - Properly mapped quantumgardener.blog to quantumgardener.info so links rewrite. Next year once I know all old RSS links have moved on I'll let .blog lapse.  
> - Styling changes. Table of Contents, Backlinks, Graph view and Recent notes now all have consistent headings, links and spacing. Slowly I’m getting to understand SCSS. Was really annoying they were inconsistent. 
> - Backlinks, Graph view and Recent notes are now collapsable. 
> - [Fixed a search bug](https://github.com/quantumgardener/qg.info/compare/ffbc8a1c1925afa49eb75d4d78525162317b5e7e...77fbac5f1fab7232c212f072b19bade47f7ecb05) where in certain cases, the attempt to highlight the first occurrence of the search term on the page caused the search box to jump about the screen
> - Fixed a en-GB locale problem where language changes were being ignored in favour of en-US (Jacky has since put it through as a patch).  
> - Move Remote notes to left side ahead of content on desktop and after content on mobile  
> - Added subscribe RSS icon to Remote notes heading  
> - Made footers look better 
> - Add help icons to Backlinks and Graph view

> [!example] Content changes
> - Rewrote my start page. Check out [[Universal Map of Concepts|Universal Map of Concepts]] for a good idea of where it's going.  
> - Added a lot of smaller notes

Can you see the difference in effort? I feel deep into [[The optimisation-procrastination trap]]. 

Here's the list again. I've highlighted the items that make a real difference.

Yep, that's the sum total of advancement for a week's work.
