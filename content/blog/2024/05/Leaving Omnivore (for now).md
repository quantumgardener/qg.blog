I've been a big fan of [[Omnivore]], but for now I'm pulling all my [[RSS Feed]]s. The team has been open about RSS being a beta feature, and my patience has run out.

- Feeds are not reliably downloaded. XKCD and PostSecret are the worst two. I have to click through to the original post to get images.
- Sync is unreliable. Items "deleted" from one system remain on the other.
- Deletion is awkward in the browser and behaviour is inconsistent. I can click an article to delete it, then the next without problems. Another time, the delete button drops down further with each article.
- And finally, the is no OPML export feature. That should have been there from Day 1

Note taking and the ability to import articles into [[Obsidian]] are plusses. The reliability is what's killing it for me for now.

For now I'm back with [[Reeder]]. That's going to limit me to Mac and iOS which is unfortunate. Nothing is perfect. I will continue to use Omnivore as my read it later app for now.
