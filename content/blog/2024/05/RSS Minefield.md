You make one simple change. A few days ago I reorganised blog posts into a `YYYY/MM` folder structure. Within the processing, this added a two `../` into the links because the articles have moved downwards two folders.

Four months ago, I added code to `.replaceAll("../", "https://quantumgardener.info/")` which had the impact of providing a link that looks like this: `https://quantumgardener.info/https://quantumgardener.info/https://quantumgardener.info/notes/obsidian` and that clearly ain't right.

This is now fixed. Articles are now in proper latest-first order as well[^1].

As a test, here's a quick link to [[Cities Skylines II]] which I'll be playing tomorrow rather breaking things any further here.

Thanks to [Euan Semple](https://quantumgardener.info/https://quantumgardener.info/https://quantumgardener.info/notes/obsidian) for taking the time to point out the links weren't working. 

[^1]: At least by date if not yet date and time.
