Today I posted the documentation on my [[IMatch to Socials]] project. It's been somewhat of a labour of love over the past couple of months to write code that will automate the upload and update of images from [[IMatch]] to my [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcbuchan/) and [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.au/dcbuchan) accounts.

It's the second best code that I've ever written and I'm proud of how elegant it is. The best code I ever wrote was third- or fourth-year university where I wrote code for a [balanced binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree) using recursion. 

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a **self-balancing binary search tree** (BST) is any [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science) "Node (computer science)")-based [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree "Binary search tree") that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.

The textbook that gave the example of how to add items to the tree and keep it balanced said quite clearly, "Deletion is complex and beyond the scope of this book". It took some time but I nutted it out. Lots of elegant recursion so in the end, not that much code at all.

I learned a lot from my IMatch project. Time to take a breather and finish processing photos before I launch into the Facebook and Instagram uploads. I have an idea on how to do it and have some testing under my belt, but will leave it for now. Being able to post my images near identically to four platforms will be great. The hard work is done. Once I have the connection and authentication nutted out, it will be quick.

During the same period I've also investigate and purchased [DxO PureRAW<sup>4</sup>](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-pureraw/) for digital noise reduction in my photos. It's amazing. You can see my first sample image below.

This was a quick snap of the moon (not seen here) in early evening. Zooming in further show just what the difference is with the original on the left and the processed image on the right. Chalk and cheese.

When I was testing the processing took 3m48s for this image and about the same for others. On my Macbook Air which has dedicated AI processers the time was down to 10.85s but there was an associated workflow cost as my photos are best accessed via Windows. So, on Sunday last I purchased the parts for a new PC. Everything except the system and data drives and monitors, and built a PC. A Ryzen 5 7600x CPU and GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card have cut that time a further 20% to 8.2s. I had to upgrade the PC anyway as the older one was not Windows 11 compatible (note Windows 10 is out of support later next year). My first installation of a CPU and my first purchase of a dedicated graphics card.

The work here, whilst technical, has given me an energy I've not had in a long time. Something of my own to focus on and develop. There is more of that to come.
