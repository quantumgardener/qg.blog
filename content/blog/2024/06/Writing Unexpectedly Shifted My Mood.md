Like you, I have my work strengths and weaknesses. I also have things I like about my job and situations that frustrate me. Working through an opportunity to redefine elements of my role I have today created a list of strengths and frustrations.

The frustrations have been there for a long time and a couple of hours after writing them down I realised there had been a shift and I now feel empowered to act upon them. Until now I've complained and very much treated them as caused by other people or systems.

The act of writing, which engaged both [[Language]] and [[Body]], shifted my [[Mood]] and corresponding outlook to my situation. I have moved from [[Frustration]] (and let's admit often [[Anger]]) to [[Acceptance]] and with that I have newfound power to take actions previously unavailable to me.

Here is a lesson I must remember.
