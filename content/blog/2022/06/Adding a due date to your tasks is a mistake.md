The [[Getting Things Done]] methodology would have us not date tasks at all and instead work through _contexts_ that help us make decisions on what do to based on the resources available to us. If something must happen on a day, use a calendar instead.

My dated tasks had become a calendar in another form.

Typically I will add dates when when:

- The task is tracking something I'm _waiting for_. There will be a date for when the request is made and a date for when I require a response. Having said that, fewer waiting for tasks are getting a response date. I'll catch that in my weekly review.
- In my role I have quite a number of task that recur weekly, fortnighly or monthly. As my calendar is for blocked time I don't want to store these tasks there. Instead I have them as tasks with dates and I roll the dates over each time. These include reports I have to run, bank transfers I need to make, backups that have to occur etc. In total these tasks wouldn't take more than 30 minutes in a day and it doesn't matter when on that day they get done. This approach gets them out of my mind and into my trusted system.

I still find myself falling into the habit of adding due dates. It's easier than remembering to look at the task list each morning and **trust myself**.
