It only takes a single sentence to peturb. Last night, while listening to [Episode 70: Anatomy of a Project List (nestedfolderspodcast.com)](https://nestedfolderspodcast.com/podcast/episode-70-anatomy-of-a-project-list/), one of those sentences came out of the blue and has had me thinking every since.

[Rosemary Orchard](https://twitter.com/rosemaryorchard) at one point said something like, "That's not a project. That's a goal." Immediately gears started turning in my head and I realised that many of my projects are in fact goals. It explains a lot why nothing ever happens on them. My focus and attention is wrong. I'm trying to go from goal to next action (task) and it's too big a leap.

Here's an example project title. "Update photo library". Granted, it is one of those on-going "projects" that never ends. Under it I know I need to:

- curate the photos of the last 6-9 months
- add the most recent photos taken by family members
- add metadata to those photos
- review all existing photos not yet marked "Final" for metadata, events and people
- scan the remaining photo albums

It all boils down to "work on some of that stuff when I have the inclination to"

Now I'm thinking a little differently. My **role** is _Curator of family memories_ with the **goal** to _Add metadata to all family photos_. Why that goal is important to me, I've not yet parsed.

From there, and as I review my role and goal, I'll come up with projects. They will be something like:

- Scan album 15
- Review metadata on photos from 1985
- Import January 2022's photos from Dropbox

Smaller, more focussed, and more likely to provide a sense of achievement.

I'm looking forward to seeing where I end up.
