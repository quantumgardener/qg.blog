During my mediation practice this morning, one of the distractions I had to deal with was considering what "meditation practice" actually means.

Is it practice to improve?


Or, practice as in something habitual or repeated?

I came to the conclusion it's the latter simply because if the focus of your meditation practice is to get better at meditation, then I believe you're missing the point of it all.
