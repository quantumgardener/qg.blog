[1711 as reported on Wikiipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1711).

Why am I looking at this page?

Sitting by the fire outside and I can see Canopus in the sky above me.

It is 311 light years away.

So I matched up light I see now with what happened 311 years ago in 1711.

Looking up always instills me with wonder.
