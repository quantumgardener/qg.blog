What tribe do you lead is the fundamental question in Seth Godin's book, *[Tribes: We need you to lead us](http://amazon.com/dp/1591842336/? tag=quantumgarden-20)*. It got me thinking about the various tribes I'm a tribe member of and the leadership present or available in each.

Make no mistake, this is a book that challenges the status-quo. In fact, it may be better to say it challenges the status-quo about the status-quo. Within there is a challenge to lead which is so compelling you may find you've made the decision not to lead and didn't realise it. This is quite different from the traditional view that leadership is a choice. Tribes shows us there is almost no way not to lead a tribe.
