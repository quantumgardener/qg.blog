On Thursday morning my doctor said I was “burnt out” and told me to take a week to begin recovery and planning for the future. Deep inside I knew it and likely have since November (or earlier 😮) but didn’t want to admit it.

The signs were there in my language, my moods/emotions, and my body. Over the next week I’ll be writing sharing some of my thoughts as I have the necessary conversations I need to get well.
