The decision is made. For my personal digital garden at least, and likely work as well, I will be staying with [[Obsidian]] and not progressing further with [[Logseq]].

I put down my first observations in writing [[Looking into Logseq|earlier today]].

Any database, and my collection of Obsidian pages is one of those, is only as good as the answers to the questions you ask of it. I don't think I can get Logseq to provide those answers due to subtle changes in the data structure. The effort involved far outweighs the benefits.

Logseq is a great applications. It doesn't do what I need. Onward Obsidian!
