Standing on the edge of the garden you can see several intriguing landscapes spread out in front of you. Where shall we head?

[[Quartz/tags/expand-my-way-of-being|Expand My Way of Being]] — My Way of Being is more than the behaviour I show. It’s the total sum of how I engage with the world, make meaning from my environment and take action. Expanding my Way of Being by being a learner in the world creates new possibilities for me to move forward in life.

[[Quartz/tags/hobby-together|Hobby Together]] — Here’s where I share my progress on whatever project currently takes my fancy, plus any relevant discussion on supporting technologies.

[[productive-laziness|Productive Laziness]] — There is art in doing as much as possible, as easily as possible and that’s what I call being productive lazy. It’s the term I use to describe my approach of doing as much as possible with as little effort as possible and applies particularly to repetitive tasks where I want them done quickly and without having to think too much. There is too much going on in my world to allow thinking where I don’t need to.

[[the-garden-shed|The Garden Shed]] — Every garden needs a good shed, full of the right tools to make it flourish.
