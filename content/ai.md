I do not use generative AI to create content for this site.

I do sparingly use Microsoft Copilot AI to help me write a paragraph where I know the idea I'm wanting to get across but I can't find quite the right words. Everything generated this way is reviewed to make sure it conforms to my initial intentions.

Javascript with Typescript is a relatively new programming language for me and I'm leaning heavily into Microsoft Copilot over general web search to help me with tricky coding problems. Most often by pasting in my code with "fix this". I always review the code returned to make sure it conforms with what I need. 

I sometimes use AI in the photo editing process to assist with tasks that could otherwise be done by hand. Within [[Affinity Photo]] this is currently limited to the [Inpainting brush tool](https://affinity.help/photo2/en-US.lproj/index.html?page=pages/Retouching/retouching_cloningHealing.html&title=Cloning%20and%20healing)

Sometimes AI forms part of my research process to help me gather alternative viewpoints.
