I do not use generative AI to create content for this site.

I do sparingly use AI to help me write a paragraph where I know the idea I'm wanting to get across but I can't find quite the right words. Everything generated this way is reviewed to make sure it conforms to my initial intentions.

I sometimes use AI in the photo editing process to assist with tasks that could otherwise be done by hand. Within [[Affinity Photo]] this is currently limited to the [Inpainting brush tool](https://affinity.help/photo2/en-US.lproj/index.html?page=pages/Retouching/retouching_cloningHealing.html&title=Cloning%20and%20healing)

Sometimes AI forms part of my research process to help me gather alternative viewpoints.
